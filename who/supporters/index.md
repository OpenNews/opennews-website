### Sponsors of SRCCON

OpenNews' annual conference [SRCCON](https://srccon.org) brings together developers, designers, and data analysts in newsrooms—and many others in allied roles and fields—for two days of peer-to-peer sessions built around conversation and collaboration. SRCCON, now in its fourth year, has benefitted from the generosity of sponsors to help underwrite the cost of things like travel scholarships, transcription, and even super tasty coffee.
