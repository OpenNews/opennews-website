### Sponsors of SRCCON

[SRCCON events](https://srccon.org) bring together developers, designers, journalists, editors, and allies: the practitioners and leaders who are transforming their newsrooms into more representative and innovative places to work. From the very first SRCCON in 2014, the generosity of sponsors has helped underwrite the cost of things like travel scholarships, transcription, and even super tasty coffee.
