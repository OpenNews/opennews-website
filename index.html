<h2>A community celebration: What—and who—Helped us get through this year</h2>

<p class="bodybig" style="margin-bottom: 3em;">We’re going to close down 2020 with some time to party, reflect, relax, and catch up with each other. Join us for a day of activities and celebration of YOU, the people who lead and sustain this work of transforming journalism. <a href="https://srccon.org/srccon-heart-2020/">Find out more about SRCCON:❤️</a> and <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/130622460295/">grab your ticket</a>, which is free for OpenNews sustainers.</p>





<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">How we’re supporting each other</h2>

<p>In this unexpected year, we’re finding ways to <a href="/what/community/covid19-care-package">take care of one another</a> while continuing to <a href="/blog/dei-coalition-announcement/">push for change</a>. We’re always working on new projects and events to help support this community. <a href="/what/community/covid19-care-package">Go to our COVID-19 Community Care Package.</a></p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">What We Believe</h2>

<p>When a community of peers listens to each other and learns together, we build a more equitable future for journalism. By creating space for <a href="https://srccon.org/">conversations at SRCCON events</a>, helping journalists <a href="https://source.opennews.org/">share their work at Source</a>, and connecting community members through a wide <a href="/what/community">range of support programs</a>, we make it easier for people to collaborate across organizations. Learn more about what we do or find out how <a href="/getinvolved">you can get involved</a>.</p>
