<p class="bodybig">OpenNews closes out 2017 with two major efforts to understand and support the needs of the community working at the intersection of journalism and technology. First, we've released our <a href="/blog/news-nerd-survey-2017">annual News Nerd Survey</a>, with an expanded effort to understand career trajectories, inclusive policies, and skill-building needs. Then, at <a href="/blog/srccon-work-open">SRCCON:WORK in December</a>, we have two days devoted to supporting one another in creating caring, collaborative workplaces.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">What We Believe</h2>

<p>We believe a diverse community of peers working, learning, and solving problems together can create the stronger, more representative ecosystem that journalism needs to thrive. Through <a href="/what/conferences">events for newsroom coders and journalists</a> and a wide range of <a href="/what/community">community and project support programs</a>, we enable collaboration across organizations. Learn more about what we do or find out how you <a href="/getinvolved">can get involved</a>.</p>
