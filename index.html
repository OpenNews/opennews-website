<p class="bodybig">We know that if we’re going to transform newsroom code and culture, we need to invest in the people who do the work. This December, we're hosting <a href="https://work.srccon.org">SRCCON:WORK</a> as a chance to dig more deeply into how we create teams that take care of each other, represent our readers, and give our communities the coverage they deserve. <a href="https://work.srccon.org">Join us</a>.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">What We Believe</h2>

<p>We believe a diverse community of peers working, learning, and solving problems together can create the stronger, more representative ecosystem that journalism needs to thrive. Through <a href="/what/conferences">events for newsroom coders and journalists</a> and a wide range of <a href="/what/community">community and project support programs</a>, we enable collaboration across organizations. Learn more about what we do or find out how you <a href="/getinvolved">can get involved</a>.</p>
