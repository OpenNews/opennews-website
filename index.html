<p class="bodybig">We recently launched a new pathway to support the journalism-code community and OpenNews: <a href="/donate">a founding sustainer program</a> for ongoing financial contributions. This network is pushing to create more inclusive, equitable, and purpose-driven journalism, and this sustainer program offers a concrete way to support that work and the community we serve. <a href="/blog/lead-launch-sustainer/">Learn more and consider joining as a sustainer</a>.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">What We Believe</h2>

<p>We believe a diverse community of peers working, learning, and solving problems together can create the stronger, more representative ecosystem that journalism needs to thrive. Through <a href="/what/conferences">events for newsroom coders and journalists</a> and a wide range of <a href="/what/community">community and project support programs</a>, we enable collaboration across organizations. Learn more about what we do or find out how you <a href="/getinvolved">can get involved</a>.</p>
