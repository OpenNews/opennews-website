<p class="caption" style="margin-top: 10px;">We're flying off to a new home. And later this year we'll return to the site of this photo, with <a href="httsp://srccon.org">SRCCON</a> back in Minneapolis. (photo/<a href="http://www.westraco.com/">Erik Westra</a>)</p>

<p class="bodybig">We're thrilled to share news about a new grant from the Knight Foundation for our work. With this grant, we also have a new home as a project of <a href="http://www.communitypartners.org/">Community Partners</a>. Mozilla nurtured our program for six years, and we're excited about this chance to strike out on our own and expand our offerings of events and community supports. Read all the details on our blog.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">What We Believe</h2>

<p>We believe a diverse community of peers working, learning, and solving problems together can create the stronger, more representative ecosystem that journalism needs to thrive. Through <a href="/what/conferences">events for newsroom coders and journalists</a> and a wide range of <a href="/what/community">community and project support programs</a>, we enable collaboration across organizations. Learn more about what we do or find out how you <a href="/getinvolved">can get involved</a>.</p>
