<p class="bodybig">We're back in Minneapolis for <a href="/blog/srccon-five/">our fifth SRCCON</a>, where we get to spend two days with 300 news nerds talking about how we experiment in the open, support one another, and lead change. This year, we'll also <a href="/blog/dan-stepping-away">mark a transition at OpenNews</a> with Director Dan Sinker leaving in July and Deputy Director Erika Owens moving into the role. With this transition, we're asking for <a href="https://opennews.networkforgood.com/projects/54161">support from community members</a> to ensure our work can continue to grow and transform in the ways journalism needs.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">What We Believe</h2>

<p>We believe a diverse community of peers working, learning, and solving problems together can create the stronger, more representative ecosystem that journalism needs to thrive. Through <a href="/what/conferences">events for newsroom coders and journalists</a> and a wide range of <a href="/what/community">community and project support programs</a>, we enable collaboration across organizations. Learn more about what we do or find out how you <a href="/getinvolved">can get involved</a>.</p>
