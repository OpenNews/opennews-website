<p><a name="carepackage"></a>SRCCON takes place as during a global pandemic and reckoning in journalism.

<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">What We Believe</h2>

<p>When a community of peers listens to each other and learns together, we build a more equitable future for journalism. By creating space for <a href="https://srccon.org/">conversations at SRCCON events</a>, helping journalists <a href="https://source.opennews.org/">share their work at Source</a>, and connecting community members through a wide <a href="/what/community">range of support programs</a>, we make it easier for people to collaborate across organizations. Learn more about what we do or find out how <a href="/getinvolved">you can get involved</a>.</p>
