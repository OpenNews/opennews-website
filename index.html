<p class="bodybig">In-person events can change a journalist's career by expanding their network of support, and a scholarship can provide access to the just the right place at just the right time. Our first round of 2019 ticket+travel scholarships will help 17 news nerds get to 8 different journalism events over the next few months. We'll open another round of scholarships soonâ€”if you have your eye on an event coming up later this year, <a href="/what/community/scholarships/">we want you to keep in touch</a>!</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 30px;">What We Believe</h2>

<p>We believe a diverse community of peers working, learning, and solving problems together can create the stronger, more representative ecosystem that journalism needs to thrive. Through <a href="/what/conferences">events for newsroom coders and journalists</a> and a wide range of <a href="/what/community">community and project support programs</a>, we enable collaboration across organizations. Learn more about what we do or find out how you <a href="/getinvolved">can get involved</a>.</p>
