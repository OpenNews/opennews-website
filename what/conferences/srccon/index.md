<p class="bodybig"><a href="http://srccon.org/">SRCCON returns for 2017!</a> Join us in Minneapolis, Minnesota on August 3 and 4 for two amazing days of building better newsroom code, culture, and process—together.</p>

We'll be publishing a lot more information, including hotel info and ticket and session-pitch deadlines in March. In the meantime, learn more about [SRCCON 2016's sessions](https://2016.srccon.org/schedule/), [check out our transcripts](https://2016.srccon.org/transcription/), and start planning your pitches now. (SRCCON is a popular event, so to keep up with all the details, you’ll want to [get on the announcements list](http://eepurl.com/czSVTL).)
