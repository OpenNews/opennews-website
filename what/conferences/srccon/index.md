<p class="bodybig">With SRCCON Events, we design conferences that empower and celebrate the journalism tech community. Participants join for two days to collaborate on the tools, strategies, and processes we need to nurture inclusive, innovative newsrooms.</p>

## SRCCON

At [SRCCON 2017](https://srccon.org), we gathered again in Minneapolis for two days of sessions, meals, social activities, and great hallway conversations. Participants left SRCCON re-energized and with new strategies for their newsrooms coming out of sessions including building software to cover democracy, tools for inter-newsroom collaboration, mentorship in the newsroom, and many others.

About a third of the sessions [were transcribed](https://srccon.org/transcription/) to share with people who werenâ€™t able to attend, and as a reference point for continued work on the questions that came up at SRCCON. You can also find [writeups about many sessions on Source](https://source.opennews.org/articles/tags/srccon-2017/), including details about [skill testing for journalism tech jobs](https://source.opennews.org/articles/journalism-needs-better-skills-testing/), an open and candid look at [supporting caregivers in newsrooms](https://source.opennews.org/articles/caregiving-and-journalism/), and our closing talk on [the importance of inclusion in journalism](https://source.opennews.org/articles/acknowledging-our-full-selves/). 

For many, SRCCON and the followups published in Source are where they find the tools, skills, and community they need to help transform their newsrooms.

## SRCCON:WORK

[SRCCON:WORK](https://work.srccon.org/) is a brand new event for 2017, a small conference that explores how we as a community can help each other take on the hard work of journalism. It builds on the collaborative, community-driven work of SRCCON and gives us a chance to dig more deeply into how we create teams that take care of each other, represent our readers, and give our communities the coverage they deserve.

This December, we'll host [SRCCON:WORK](https://work.srccon.org/) in Philadelphia. Through sessions on collaboration, career growth, and self care, participants at transition points in their career will be able to make connections and take home strategies that will sustain them in this work.
