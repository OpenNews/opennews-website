<p class="bodybig"><a href="http://srccon.org/">SRCCON returns for 2016!</a> Join us in Portland, Oregon on July 28 and 29 for two amazing days of building better newsroom code, culture, and processâ€”together.</p>

We'll be publishing a lot more information, including hotel info and ticket and session-pitch deadlines in early 2016. In the meantime, learn more about [SRCCON 2015's sessions](http://2015.srccon.org/schedule/), [check out our transcripts](http://2015.srccon.org/transcription/), and start planning your pitches now. (We sold out tickets in <em>45 seconds</em> last year, so if you're interested, you'll want to [get on the announcements list](http://eepurl.com/bD2F3P).)
