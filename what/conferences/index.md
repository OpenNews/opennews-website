<p class="bodybig">We create spaces where the journalism-code community can gather and focus on the informal skillshares and insightful conversations that are the best parts of conferences.</p>

We host events designed to provide space for those conversations and collaborations to bloom, surrounded by plentiful food, good coffee, and enthusiastic colleagues. We also host cohort-driven convenings to allow small groups of participants to really dig into questions and projects.</p>

## [SRCCON, the OpenNews Conference](srccon)

[SRCCON](srccon) is a hands-on conference focused on the practical challenges news technology and data teams encounter every day. We welcome participants from all fieldsâ€”if you want to strengthen journalism online, we want you there. The conference returns in August 2017 for its fourth year, plus at the end of 2017 we'll have a bonus smaller topical SRCCON, too. [Find out more.](srccon)

## [Code, Culture, and Leadership Convenings](/what/conferences/convenings)

These cohort-driven convenings give a small group of participants a chance to explore tough questions and projects, together. Modeled off of our Code Convenings program, in 2017 the format will expand to include topics beyond code. [Learn more](/what/conferences/convenings).
