<p class="bodybig">We create spaces where the journalism-code community can gather and focus on the informal skillshares and insightful conversations that are the best parts of conferences.</p>

We host events designed to provide space for those conversations and collaborations to bloom, surrounded by plentiful food, good coffee, and enthusiastic colleagues. We also host cohort-driven convenings to allow small groups of participants to really dig into questions and projects.</p>

## [SRCCON Events](srccon)

[SRCCON](srccon) is our largest event, a hands-on conference focused on the practical challenges news technology and data teams encounter every day. In August, we hosted our fourth SRCCON, and participants [tackled everything from hiring technical staff to caregiving](https://source.opennews.org/articles/tags/srccon-2017/). This year, we're hosting our first-ever SRCCON:WORK to explore how we as a community can help each other take on the hard work of journalism. [Find out more](srccon).

## [Code, Culture, and Leadership Convenings](/what/conferences/convenings)

These cohort-driven convenings give a small group of participants a chance to explore tough questions and projects, together. Modeled off of our Code Convenings program, in 2017 the format will expand to include topics beyond code. [Learn more](/what/conferences/convenings).
