### SRCCON Events - truly connecting at a conference
SRCCON conferences are two days of community connection, collaborative sessions, and a ton of documentation. As one attendee put it, <em>“The structure of the program and the attention to detail and people’s needs is what makes this an exceptional and special event.”</em> We’ve been hosting SRCCON events since 2014, and [have gathered years of writing](https://srccon.org/our-resources#participant-experience) about how we create these inclusive, participatory spaces as well as session documentation, and resources that inspired us from the start. 

### Building meaningful events
Part of how we've developed our SRCCON Events approach, is by being active participants at a ton of conferences ourselves and designing a range of other types of events. Through a series of small group [code, culture, and leadership convenings](/what/conferences/convenings/), we saw how teams working on separate projects still build relationships with each other, and how working side-by-side strengthens everyone’s projects. And from 2011-19 at the Mozilla Festival, we learned from our friends at Aspiration Tech and the Mozilla Foundation about designing interdisciplinary and interactive spaces, like this [journalism unconference we hosted](https://opennews.org/what/conferences/mozfest).
