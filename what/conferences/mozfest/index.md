<p class="bodybig"> OpenNews is heading back to the <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">Mozilla Festival</a>, a multi-day, annual celebration of the open internet for technologists, makers, educators, and creators in all fields. This year, we're organizing [full day of journalism-tech sessions](https://ti.to/Mozilla/mozfestHouse-opennews) at the <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/house">MozFest House</a> on October 25.

## OpenNews Unconference on Journalism Tech
All day on Thursday, October 25 we'll have hands-on, collaborative sessions from local London journalists and visitors coming to town for the festival. The event takes place at the [Royal Society of Arts](https://www.google.com/maps/place/RSA+House/@51.5093702,-0.1248943,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487604c9572d71f1:0xc61aaa0727953544!8m2!3d51.5093669!4d-0.1227056) in central London.

Participants can [register now](https://ti.to/Mozilla/mozfestHouse-opennews) and tickets will cost Â£50 each. Many of the sessions will be scheduled that morning, and we're working to confirm a bunch of sessions in advance, too. You can expect sessions from:

* Simon Jockers about using public statistics and open data in journalism and his experience with [Datenguide](https://datengui.de/)
* Federica Cherubini and Sarah Marshall of Hacks/Hackers London with "If you build it, they will come: A workshop in how to create an audience-first strategy" 
* us! (the OpenNews team) facilitating a session about...facilitation and how we [build our SRCCON events](https://srccon.org/our-resources)
* journalists from the BBC News Labs and Full Fact, which will be returning to present at the unconference for the second year in a row
* maybe also you? If you're interested in bringing a session, [let us know](mailto:erika@opennews.org) or you can of course pitch that day as well

Throughout the day, we'll have the chance to discuss stories, strategies, and tools in sessions and over a group lunch.

Our rough schedule will be:

* 9:30-10am - registration, with light breakfast
* 10-10:30am - unconference brainstorming
* 10:30-10:45am - schedule creation and introduction to unconferencing!
