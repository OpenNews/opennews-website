<p class="bodybig"> OpenNews is heading back to the <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">Mozilla Festival</a>, a multi-day, annual celebration of the open internet for technologists, makers, educators, and creators in all fields. This year, we're also organizing [full day of journalism-tech sessions](https://ti.to/Mozilla/mozfestHouse-opennews) on October 25.

## OpenNews Unconference on Journalism Tech
All day on Thursday, October 25 we'll have hands-on, collaborative sessions from local London journalists and visitors coming to town for the festival.

Participants can [register now](https://ti.to/Mozilla/mozfestHouse-opennews) and tickets will cost Â£50 each. Many of the sessions will be scheduled that morning, but we're working to confirm a bunch of sessions in advance, too.

Throughout the day, we'll have the chance to discuss stories, strategies, and tools in sessions and over a group lunch.
