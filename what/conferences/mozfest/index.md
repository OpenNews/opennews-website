<p class="bodybig"> OpenNews is heading back to the <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">Mozilla Festival</a>, a multi-day, annual celebration of the open internet for technologists, makers, educators, and creators in all fields. This year, we're organizing [full day of journalism-tech sessions](https://ti.to/Mozilla/mozfestHouse-opennews) at the <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/house">MozFest House</a> on October 24.

## Teams & collaboration: How an interdisciplinary approach gets the work done in journalism tech
All day on Thursday, October 24 we'll have hands-on, collaborative sessions from local London journalists and visitors coming to town for the festival. The event takes place at the [Royal Society of Arts](https://www.google.com/maps/place/RSA+House/@51.5093702,-0.1248943,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487604c9572d71f1:0xc61aaa0727953544!8m2!3d51.5093669!4d-0.1227056) in central London.

This year the event will have a theme! It's going to be about teams, collaboration, and the interdisciplinary perspectives that help us to work well in journalism and tech. We'll have a range of sessions about how we work together, how we enage folks from disciplines outside of journalism, and what we need to do to create cultures that are welcoming to all perspectives and value innovative thinking.

Registration will open soon and tickets will cost Â£15 each. Many of the sessions will be scheduled that morning, and we're working to confirm a bunch of sessions in advance, too. If you're interested in bringing a session, [let us know](mailto:erika@opennews.org). Stay tuned here for updates!

Throughout the day, we'll have the chance to discuss stories, strategies, and tools in sessions and over breaks.

Our rough schedule will be:

* 9:30-10am - registration, unconference brainstorming
* 10-10:15am - schedule creation and introduction to unconferencing!
* 10:15-10:30am - transition to first session
* 10:30-11:30am - first session
* 11:30am-noon - break, with tea and coffee and conversation
* noon-1pm - second session
* 1pm-2:30pm - lunch on your own, explore the Strand!
* 2:30-3:30pm - third session
* 3:30-4pm - break, with snack and conversation
* 4-5pm - final session
* 5pm - wrap up

We expect it to be a busy, fun, and productive day filled with sharing about our work and building stronger connections with colleagues. Please help us to spread the word.
