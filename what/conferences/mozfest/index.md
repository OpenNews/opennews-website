<p class="bodybig"> OpenNews is heading back to the <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">Mozilla Festival</a>, a multi-day, annual celebration of the open internet for technologists, makers, educators, and creators in all fields. This year, we're also organizing a [full day of journalism-tech sessions](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/opennews-journalism-tech-unconference-tickets-37647279025) on October 26.

## OpenNews Unconference on Journalism Tech

## Journalism During MozFest
The Mozilla Festival this year features [five topical spaces](https://mozillafestival.org/spaces) around facets of the health of the internet. 

Each space will have a journalism-related session or two that explore everything from data analysis to secure communications with sources. Exploring the festival is a way to experience the many ways we shape the open web and how it, in turn, influences our work. In addition to the sessions, several of [this year's speakers](https://mozillafestival.org/speakers) are journalists who will also discuss the intersection of journalism and technology.

You can find more details on [the MozFest website](https://mozillafestival.org) or by [following @MozillaFestival](https://twitter.com/mozillafestival).
