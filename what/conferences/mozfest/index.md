<p class="bodybig">The <a href="https://mozillafestival.org/">Mozilla Festival</a> is a multi-day, annual celebration of the open internet for technologists, makers, educators, and creators in all fields. The OpenNews team organizes journalism-related program at the festival—if you attend, you'll find a whole stack of hands-on sessions on newsroom CMSes, technology choices, mapping and visualizations, and much more.

MozFest is a place for discussions, hands-on making, and wireframing. It’s a chance to explore new ways to visualize data, present information, and  foster connections between people interested in harnessing the power of  the web to create great journalism.

You can check out [last year’s session list to learn more](https://app.mozillafestival.org/#_space-journalism) and [follow @MozillaFestival](https://twitter.com/mozillafestival) to keep up with MozFest-related projects and discussions.
