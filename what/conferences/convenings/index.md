<p class="bodybig">Code, Culture, and Leadership convenings are cohort-driven events where small groups come together to work and problem-solve on a common theme.</p>

These events began with code convenings, where two-person teams from several newsrooms assembled, each with an open-source project that needed last-mile development and documentation to be ready for release. Building on that model, in 2017 we also began hosting convenings around themes that help newsrooms build new and stronger leadership, and more resilient, inclusive culture.

Over six code convenings, teams have shared projects like [Pym.js](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-pym/), the [California Civic Data Coalition](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-california-civic-data-coalition/), and [Lunchbox](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-lunchbox/), [Klaxon](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/when-bots-get-together-part-1/). At documentation-driven events, the community created [a playbook for open-source development in the newsroom](https://source.opennews.org/articles/introducing-field-guide-open-source-newsroom/) and a curriculum for [peer training on digital security for journalists](https://source.opennews.org/articles/introducing-field-guide-security-newsroom/). Other cohort-driven events have focused on leadership and community allyship, [emerging from a session at SRCCON](https://source.opennews.org/articles/aim-misbehave-allies-and-privileges-media-creation/), and on [training and collaboration for "local coders."](https://opennews.org/blog/local-coders-convening/)

During these events, we've seen how teams working on separate projects still build relationships with each other, and how working side-by-side strengthens everyone's projects. Our convenings have grown to emphasize relationship-building and cohort support even more explicitly as participants come together to take on projects and questions.
