<p class="bodybig">Code, Culture, and Leadership convenings are cohort-driven events where small groups come together to work and problem solve on a common theme.</p>

The convenings began as code convenings, where two-person teams from several newsrooms assembled, each with an open source project that needed last-mile development and documentation to be ready for release. Building on that model, in 2017 we will host convenings around the types of culture and leadership challenges that can accompany the implementation of great code projects.

Over the last three years, we hosted seven code convenings, which helped teams document and share projects like [Pym.js](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-pym/), the [California Civic Data Coalition](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-california-civic-data-coalition/), [Lunchbox](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-lunchbox/), [Klaxon](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/when-bots-get-together-part-1/), and a forthcoming [open source playbook](https://source.opennews.org/articles/building-guide-open-sourcing-newsroom-code/). During these convenings, we saw how even teams working on separate projects built relationships and that working side-by-side strengthened everyone's projects. With the new styles of convenings, we're going to emphasize relationship building and cohort support even more explicitly as participants work together on projects and questions.
