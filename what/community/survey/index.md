<p class="bodybig">In order to strengthen and sustain this community, we need to understand its needs. News nerds play many roles as they push for technical and cultural innovation in journalism, and this data helps us figure out how to help each other. </p> 

The survey is back! [Please take a few minutes to share your experiences](https://www.research.net/r/2022_OpenNewsSurvey). If you have any questions abut the survey, [reach out to Erika](mailto:erika@opennews.org). We'll share further details [in our newsletter](https://opennews.us5.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=71c95e9a43708843d2fdc1f09&id=996e9290cc) and the full results later in 2022.

### Why have we invested in this survey?
This survey helps us understand the community affectionately known as the “news nerds,” the developers, designers, editors, data analysts, and product folks who work in tech and journalism. These folks seek out opportunities to support one another, to build technical and managerial skills, and to create inclusive organizations. This survey helps news nerds, and the organizations like OpenNews that support them, to push for more responsive, equitable news organizations that are better able to serve their communities. Funding from Democracy Fund makes this survey possible.

### 2022 Survey 
After a few quiet years, we've brought the survey back to gather new data on how the field of journalism is evolving, as well as who makes up the news nerd community and other groups served by OpenNews. We expect this iteration of the survey will help inform future work and will help us devise a plan for more regular community surveying, especially in the context of much more data about the field [from other sources](https://datajournalism.com/survey/2021/), too.

### 2017 Survey
In 2017, we expanded the survey with the support of Google News Lab and the contributions of a community advisory group including Soo Oh, John S. Knight Fellow; Jennifer Lee, Google News Lab; and Liam Andrew, The Texas Tribune. Network Impact again developed and administered the survey which received 756 responses. We gathered [highlights of the data in a visualization](/projects/2017-newsnerd-survey/) made by Google and [shared the findings and next steps](/blog/news-nerd-survey-2017). 

### 2016 Survey
In 2016, we conducted the first community survey of people working in journalism technology. The survey was planned by community members Brian Hamman and Scott Klein and developed by the research firm Network Impact. This survey received 514 responses and helped us develop a baseline of understanding of the community and its needs. It was so helpful, we decided to make it an annual resource! We [released the results at the 2017 NICAR conference](/blog/news-nerd-survey/).
