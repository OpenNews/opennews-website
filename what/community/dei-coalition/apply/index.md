<h2>Join The DEI Coalition</h2>
<h3>DEI Coalition For Anti-Racist, Equitable, And Just Newsrooms</h3>

<p>Membership in the DEI Coalition is free, and if you meet the membership criteria below, we'd love for you to join! Just fill out our membership request form at the bottom of this page.</p>  

<p>Want to learn more about what the DEI Coalition is? <a href="/what/community/dei-coalition/">Get more information here.</a></p>

<div class="membership">
  <h2>General Membership Criteria</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You identify as a journalist, work in the journalism industry, and/or work in a space that directly supports journalism</li>
    <li>You are committed to fighting for a future where all journalists can work in newsrooms that are anti-racist, equitable, inclusive, and collaborative, and where the communities journalism has long harmed and/or ignored can trust in journalism again, or for the first time ever.</li>
    <li>You are who you say you are (verification process will like include social media and LinkedIn; reference) </li>
  </ul>

  <p><strong>This is likely not the place for you if:</strong></p>

  <ul>
    <li>Journalism organizations probably think of you primarily as a vendor, for services such as technology or marketing</li>
    <li>You do not believe in racism, systemic bias or oppression, and/or the concept of privilege, and often challenge or shut down conversations when these topics come up</li>
    <li>You’re mostly seeking out a therapeutic experience</li>
    <li>You are hoping to exclusively host your organization’s union in this space</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Which private channels should I apply for?</h2>

  <p>In your application, you’ll have the option to apply to join private staff-only channels, private manager-only channels, or choose to apply for neither, and by default join our coalition-wide public channels.</p>

  <p>Folks who were laid off or are unemployed should look at the specific-to-space criteria/considerations based on your last role.</p>

  <p>Foundation officers committed to DEI work should select neither.</p>

  <p>These are the things that could be true about you in these spaces. These lists should help you decide which private channels you should apply to enter. You may want to choose access to staff-only or manager-only if: </p>
