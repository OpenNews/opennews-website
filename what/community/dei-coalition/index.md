<p class="bodybig">Together, OpenNews and over 100 members of the journalism community have co-created a digital community space dedicated to sharing knowledge and taking concrete action in service of a more anti-racist, equitable and just journalism industry. Together, members can use this shared community space, hosted on Slack, to tackle challenging conversations, create new resources, equip themselves to be better allies and advocates, and together, change newsroom policies, systems, and culture for the better.</p>

<p class="button"><a href="/what/community/dei-coalition/join/">ðŸ‘‰ Join the DEI Coalition Slack</a></p>

Membership for the DEI Coalition Slack community space is free, and if you identify as a journalist, work in the journalism industry, and/or work in a space that directly supports journalism, youâ€™re eligible to join.


<h3>Private Channels</h3>
The DEI Coalition Slack includes channels for everyone â€” dedicated to conversations around anything from power to compensation equity to allyshipâ€” as well as private channels just for coalition members in staff and management roles. We acknowledge that different roles in organizations come with different challenges and different ways to create change. These private staff-only or manager-only channels serve as a way for people in similar positions of power to learn from each otherâ€™s actions and strategies. Our page on [joining the coalition](/what/community/dei-coalition/join/) explains how to decide which private channels to apply for, and what the main conversations in each set of private channels will be about.

<h3>Creating the DEI Coalition Slack</h3>

In July 2020, OpenNews first [announced](https://opennews.org/blog/dei-coalition-announcement/) the DEI Coalition at [SRCCON](https://2020.srccon.org/), our annual journalism conference. The core of the DEI Coalition project was to co-create with the community a digital space focused on creating anti-racist, equitable, and just newsrooms. Within a week, over 100 people had signed up to volunteer their time, perspective, and expertise, in service of creating this space.

Every part of the DEI Coalition Slack space â€” from the application process to the community agreements to  the member guide â€” were all created collaboratively by volunteers who worked together for six months. In their work shaping the coalition, they brought with them a multiplicity of perspectives from each of their lived experiences, including what itâ€™s like to move through the world based on their race, gender, sexual orientation, location, job title, perceived power, and so much more.  

Volunteers served on four main committees, each tackling different questions to help us ensure both spaces are as safe as possible, and serve the community's goals.

Our committees:

<ul>
  <li><strong>Safety and Moderation</strong> â€” led by <a href="https://twitter.com/sophanho">Sophie Ho</a></li>
  <li><strong>Membership</strong> â€” led by <a href="https://twitter.com/AshleyAlvarado">Ashley Alvarado</a></li>
  <li><strong>Slack Setup</strong> â€” led by <a href="https://twitter.com/hannahsbirch">Hannah Birch</a></li>
  <li><strong>Welcome and Onboarding</strong> â€” led by <a href="https://twitter.com/lishsavson">Alisha Wang Savson</a></li>
</ul>

On March 22, 2021, the DEI Coalition Slack formally launched and began accepting members.
