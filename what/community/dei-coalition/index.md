<p class="caption">We first announced the creation of the DEI Coalition for Anti-Racist, Equitable, and Just Newsrooms at <a href="https://2020.srccon.org/">SRCCON 2020</a>, our annual conference.</p>
<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

<p class="bodybig">To move toward a future where all journalists can work in newsrooms that are anti-racist, equitable, inclusive, and collaborative, and where the communities we‚Äôve long ignored can trust in journalism, OpenNews is co-creating with the community two digital organizing spaces focused on organizing, collective action, and knowledge sharing in the service of a more equitable journalism industry.</p>

<h3>The Work So Far</h3>

More than 100 members of the community have signed up to co-create these organizing spaces with us, and we've divided everyone up into four main committees, each tackling different questions to help us ensure both spaces are as safe as possible, and serve the community's goals.

Our committees:
