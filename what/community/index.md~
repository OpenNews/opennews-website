<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p class="bodybig">The news code community ships features, code libraries, and support systems at newsroom pace: fast. But much of the most innovative work to emerge from the community requires time spent on documentation and cross-organizational collaboration—which, in turn, requires time away from the daily grind. Our programs serve as community infrastructure, providing editorial, financial, and organizational support for this work. </p>

Source is half community hub, half magazine—a place for working journalist-coders to share experiments, case studies, and documentation. It also includes [Source Jobs](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/jobs/), where news organizations can list development, data-handling, and design jobs for free.

### [Code Convenings](convenings)

In 2014, we launched our first series of code convenings, small gatherings focused on completing and launching open-source projects. [Learn more](convenings).

### [Community Calls](calls)

Every two weeks, we host an open conference call for the international news code community. The community calls include discussions of specific, recently launched projects and tools, announcements of new events, grants, jobs, etc., and updates from the Knight-Mozilla fellows in their newsrooms around the world. They're a perfect way to connect with new collaborators and learn more about the day-to-day work of newsroom developers. [Learn more and see when the next call is scheduled](calls).

### [Event Support](eventsupport)

Since we launched OpenNews, we've sponsored over 100 hack days and journalism-related code events from Armenia to Uruguay, and hosted several of our own in conjunction with the MIT-Knight Civic Media Conference. See our [event listings on Source](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/tags/events/) for a list of upcoming events, or [learn how to apply for sponsorship](eventsupport).

### [Journalism Code Travel Scholarships](scholarships)

We know events are an important part of how the journalism-code community learns and shares with one another. Money shouldn't get in the way of attending a great event, and we want to help. [Learn more about our travel scholarship program](scholarships).
