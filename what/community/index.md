<!-- ### Supporting one another during COVID-19
During the pandemic, we're finding ways to take care of one another with our <a href="/what/community/covid19-care-package">COVID-19 Community Care Package.</a> Our work ranges from [sharing step-by-step guides](https://source.opennews.org/articles/tags/story-recipe/) to local, data-based outbreak coverage, to supporting [microloans](https://microloansforjournalists.org/) to and from journalists, to helping newsroom execs [uphold diversity and inclusive values](https://source.opennews.org/articles/newsroom-managers-diversity-inclusivity-covid19/) during COVID-19. -->

### Connecting through events 
We love creating [events that are highly participatory and inclusive](/what/conferences), where participants come first so they can can feel comfortable digging into complex problems. In addition to our events, look for us at NICAR, the Collaborative Journalism Conference, the News Product Alliance Summit and other events where we host community meals and gatherings to foster connection.

### Learning together
We seek out ways to make it easy for members of this community to learn from each other, share successes and challenges, and get an understanding of what needs to change in the field. We publish [Source](https://source.opennews.org), a site where community members document their projects and the processes behind their work. Every month, community members also share about their work on [an open community call](/what/community/calls/). The [News Nerd Survey](/what/community/survey/) has helped to understand the landscape, and unique perspective, of the technology community in journalism.

### Supporting each other
We want to make it easy for community members to access resources that will help develop their careers, and support their colleagues as well. Through our [Scholarships+ program](/what/community/scholarships/) we offer stipends for events and other training opportunities. From 2011-16, we also directly placed technologists in newsrooms to collaborate on projects: 33 [Knight-Mozilla Fellows](/what/fellowships) worked with 19 news organizations in five countries.

### Taking collective action
Together, OpenNews and over 100 members of the journalism community have co-created the [DEI Coalition For Anti-Racist, Equitable, And Just Newsrooms](/what/community/dei-coalition/), a digital community space dedicated to sharing knowledge and taking concrete action in service of a more anti-racist, equitable, and just journalism industry. OpenNews is also part of [Vision25](/blog/vision25-building-racial-equity-in-newsrooms/), a collaboration that seeks to work vigorously to build anti-racist organizations that become institutions of belonging. We also worked with The Pudding to create a [Speaker Rider for Meaningfully Inclusive Events](/projects/speaker-rider/) to help speakers and events/organizations create and maintain inclusive space for historically marginalized communities. We share [an e-mail template speakers can use](https://opennews.org/blog/speaker-rider-process/) before accepting an invitation to speak.

### Gathering resources
As we encounter resources in our daily work, we like to share them with the wider community. We've gathered up a [list of community Slacks and email lists](/what/community/hubs), and in 2020 we developed a [COVID-19 Care Package](/what/community/covid19-care-package).

### Helping other organizations
We even consult on the expertise we've developed running the above programs. [Reach out](mailto:team@opennews.org) if you would like any information about what we may be able to bring to your event or organization.
