<p class="bodybig">The journalism code community is diverse and distributed across the globe. <a href="/blog/ticket-travel-scholarship/">Events can be a great opportunity</a> to get together in person to chat and collaborate, but sometimes the cost of travel can be a hardship. To help defray the cost of attending conferences and other technical events, OpenNews offers Ticket + Travel scholarships.</p>

**Can people outside of the US apply for the scholarship?**<br>
Yep! The application is open to everyone. We welcome applications from any country. And you can apply for a scholarship to attend events outside of the US, too.

**When will I receive my scholarship?**<br>
When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. In short, we'll ask you to fill out a form to receive a stipend and a form to gather your W-9 details. Our administrators will process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.
 
**What if I need more than $500 for my travel?**<br>
We’re able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Many events and professional organizations offer their own scholarship programs as well. Or maybe your event has things like a room share board to help cut down on costs.

**Why are you offering this scholarship?**<br>
We know that a lot of important work, sharing, and learning happens at in-person events. It's not easy for everyone to get to those events though, no matter how valuable they may be. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and [offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that](/blog/ticket-travel-scholarship).

**How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?**<br>
OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities under-represented in journalism and technology and journalists from small and non-coastal newsrooms. We also prioritize applications that will allow the person to attend an event where they are speaking or otherwise making a major contribution.

**What about your conference, SRCCON?**<br>
We run a separate scholarship process for that event. You can find [more information on the SRCCON site](https://srccon.org/scholarships/).
