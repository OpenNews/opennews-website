<p class="bodybig">The journalism code community is diverse and distributed across the globe. <a href="/what/community/eventsupport">Events can be a great opportunity</a> to get together in person to chat and collaborate, but sometimes the cost of travel can be a hardship. To help defray the cost of attending conferences and other technical events, OpenNews offers Ticket + Travel scholarships.

* $500 toward the cost (travel, lodging, etc.) of attending an event on journalism technology, or an open source event where you’ll bring a journalism connection.

You tell us how it went! We'll send you a short follow-up survey and will be excited to check out any blog posts or code repos that come out of your participation in the event.

## FAQ

**What types of events are covered for travel?**<br>
If there's an event that you think would help increase your participation in the journalism code community, you should tell us about it and apply for the scholarship. 

You should apply for events coming up soon that you are interested in attending. The [January 13 application deadline](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfoFyExp32Fv-MVqxzbRLmhLLYynUOyPAoJLPYi6v_M_8XS0A/viewform) isn't your only chance to apply for coverage for an event this year. In February, we'll have more details about application deadlines for events later this year as well as other announcements. 

**Can people outside of the US apply for the scholarship?**<br>
Yep! The application is open to everyone. We welcome applications from any country. And you can apply for a scholarship to attend events outside of the US, too.

**When will I receive my scholarship?**<br>
When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. In short, you will need to send us an invoice, and our administrators will process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.
 
**What if I need more than $500 for my travel?**<br>
We’re able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Many events and professional organizations offer their own scholarship programs as well. Or maybe your event has things like a room share board to help cut down on costs.

**Why are you offering this scholarship?**<br>
We know that a lot of important work, sharing, and learning happens at in-person events. It's not easy for everyone to get to those events though, no matter how valuable they may be. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and [offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that](/blog/ticket-travel-scholarship).

**How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?**<br>
OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities under-represented in journalism and technology, as well as from people who would be unable to speak at or majorly contribute to an event without the scholarship.

**What about your conference, SRCCON?**<br>
We run a separate scholarship process for that event and will have more details about that later this year.
