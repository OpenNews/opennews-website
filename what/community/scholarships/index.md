<p class="bodybig">The journalism-code community is diverse and distributed across organizations of many sizes, in many places. Events are a great opportunity to get together in person to chat and collaborate, but the cost of travel can be a hardship. Whether you're a newsroom developer at an organization without much budget for professional development, or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, OpenNews offers scholarships that cover conference registration fees plus $500 toward helping you get there.</p>

<p>We offer scholarships because <a href="https://opennews.org/blog/scholarships-networks/">events help people build skills and relationships</a>—two things that transform how journalists work, strengthen their support networks, and open new doors no matter where they are in their career. We also know that sharing knowledge between peers is <a href="https://opennews.org/what/community/survey/">one of the key ways</a> our community builds expertise, so helping one journalist attend an event can help many journalists do better work.</p>

## FAQ

**What types of events are covered for travel?**  
We'd love to consider any event that you think would help increase your participation in the journalism-code community. There are so many national, regional, and local opportunities to connect with people working on the same kinds of projects and problems that you are. Some of the events prior scholarship recipients attended include: NICAR, Internet Freedom Festival, Data Harvest, SND, ONA, IRE, NABJ, JAWS CAMP, AAJA, EIJ, New Now Next, TextAV, and TechRaking.

The scholarship program isn't at all limited to this list, but we hope it gives you some ideas about the range of community events. We're also open to conferences and workshops on specific themes. Many of these events can help people improve their coding, data analysis and visualization, or newsroom collaboration, but we also hear from applicants who want to study topics like social justice, census data, poverty and inequality, or education, just to name a few.

**Can people outside of the U.S. apply for the scholarship?**  
Applications are open to everyone and we're open to events taking place anywhere. We prioritize applications from journalists of color and journalists from regional/local news organizations, but we're open to applications from anyone working at the intersection of journalism and technology.

**When will I receive my scholarship?**  
When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. We'll ask you to fill out a form to receive a stipend and a form to gather your W-9 details, and then our administrators will process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.
 
**What if I need more than $500 for my travel?**  
We’re able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Many events and professional organizations offer their own scholarship programs as well. Or maybe your event has things like a room-share board to help cut down on costs.

**How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?**  
OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities underrepresented in journalism and technology and journalists from small and non-coastal newsrooms. We also prioritize applications that will allow the person to attend an event where they are speaking or otherwise making a major contribution.

**What about your conference, SRCCON?**  
We run a separate scholarship process for SRCCON events. You can find more details [on the SRCCON website](https://srccon.org/scholarships/)!

**Who funds these scholarships?**  
Our scholarships are made possible by grants from the Democracy Fund and News Integrity Initiative, and [donations from community members](https://opennews.networkforgood.com/).
