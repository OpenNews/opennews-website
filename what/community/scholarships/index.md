<p class="bodybig">The journalism code community is diverse and distributed across the globe. Events can be a great opportunity to get together in person to chat and collaborate, but sometimes the cost of travel can be a hardship. To help with the cost of attending conferences and other technical events, OpenNews offers Ticket + Travel scholarships.</p> 

<p class="bodybig"><a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_FVTcK-VouOcqbjzn_-8T1jl4oRHW44R1ZnLYDK7H3RI5vQ/viewform">Applications for this round of 2018 scholarships are open through Wednesday, Jan. 24</a>.</p>

Whether you're a newsroom developer at a small organization without much budget for professional development, or a freelance developer eager to learn more about journalism code, we created this program to help you attend events.

We're excited to be able to offer ticket and travel support again in 2018, because we’ve consistently seen how valuable participating in events can be for individuals, their organizations, and the broader community. We see this program as a really meaningful way we can support the journalism community, and we expect to be able to announce more scholarship applications later this year.

If there's an event coming up that you'd like to attend, we encourage you to [apply for a scholarship now](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_FVTcK-VouOcqbjzn_-8T1jl4oRHW44R1ZnLYDK7H3RI5vQ/viewform)!

### What we're offering

* $500 toward the cost (travel, lodging, etc.) of attending an event on journalism and technology, or an open-source event where you’ll build new skills or bring a journalism connection to a new community.
* Full coverage of your event registration fee (capped at $1,000, but most events in the community cost much less).

### When applications are open

Our applications are open now through midnight Eastern on Wednesday, Jan. 24. We'll notify all applicants by Wednesday, Jan. 31.

### Who should apply

* Anyone who is part of the journalism-code community, such as developers, designers, and data analysts working in newsrooms.
* Anyone interested in learning more about the journalism-code community, such as people working in other areas of technology who want to share their development, design, or analysis skills with journalists.
* People of color, women, and other underrepresented groups in journalism and technology are strongly encouraged to apply.

### What happens after you apply

OpenNews staff will review applications, and all applicants will receive an answer by Jan. 31.

### What happens after the conference

You tell us how it went! We'll send you a short follow-up survey and will be excited to check out any blog posts or code repos that come out of your participation in the event.

## FAQ

**What types of events are covered for travel?**  
We'd love to consider any event that you think would help increase your participation in the journalism-code community. There are so many national, regional, and local opportunities to connect with people working on the same kinds of projects and problems that you are. If you think an event will help you cover your community better, we want you to [tell us about it and apply for a scholarship](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe_FVTcK-VouOcqbjzn_-8T1jl4oRHW44R1ZnLYDK7H3RI5vQ/viewform)!

**Can people outside of the U.S. apply for the scholarship?**  
Yep! The application is open to everyone. We welcome applications from any country, and you can apply for a scholarship to attend events outside of the U.S., too.

**When will I receive my scholarship?**  
When we notify scholarship recipients, we will include information about how to receive the scholarship funds. We'll ask you to fill out a form to receive a stipend and a form to gather your W-9 details, and then our administrators will process the payment. It may take a month or so for check processing.
 
**What if I need more than $500 for my travel?**  
We’re able to offer $500 scholarships at this time. Many events and professional organizations offer their own scholarship programs as well. Or maybe your event has things like a room-share board to help cut down on costs.

**Why are you offering this scholarship?**  
We know that a lot of important work, sharing, and learning happens at in-person events. It's not easy for everyone to get to those events though, no matter how valuable they may be. We know that travel costs can be a hardship, and [offer this scholarship as a way to help mitigate that](/blog/ticket-travel-scholarship).

**How do you decide who will receive a scholarship?**  
OpenNews staff reviews all applications. We prioritize applications from members of communities under-represented in journalism and technology and journalists from small and non-coastal newsrooms. We also prioritize applications that will allow the person to attend an event where they are speaking or otherwise making a major contribution.

**What about your conference, SRCCON?**  
We run a separate scholarship process for that event and will have more details about that later this year.
