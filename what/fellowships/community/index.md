<p class="caption"> All of our 33 Knight-Mozilla Fellows, plus our new <a href="/what/fellowships/2016meet">2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellows</a></p>
<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>
<p class="bodybig">The Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend 10 months working with a partner news organization, contributing to and learning from the journalism code community. A growing community of fellowship alumni also welcomes and supports each new cohort. Fellows share their curiosity,  code, and insights during their fellowship and beyond.
<br/><br/>
Meet our fellows: [2016](/what/fellowships/2016meet) | [2015](/what/fellowships/2015meet) | [2014](/what/fellowships/2014meet) | [2013](/what/fellowships/2013meet) | [2012](/what/fellowships/2011meet)

Throughout the program, we encourage fellows to explore their passions, collaborate on projects, and share their work. Here are some examples of work from current and alumni fellows.

## Explore
The mandate to explore is one of the ways a fellowship is really different from a regular job. Fellows have the time, space, and support to learn new skills, investigate topics of interest to them, and experiment to answer questions that fascinate them.

###Livia Labate - current fellow at NPR
<img src="/media/img/fellows/2015-fellows/livia60.jpg" class="fellowspage">Livia  came to the fellowship with more than a decade of UX experience, but she wanted to focus on gaining [experience with programming and shipping code](http://livialabate.com/says/so-you-think-you-can-dance/).  She's documented her efforts to learn git, get a handle on python, and work on a rapid development cycle. She has also shared her UX and audience research expertise with the NPR team while learning a ton of new skills.

### Brian Jacobs - 2014 fellow, now at National Geographic
<img src="/media/img/fellows/2014-fellows/brian-60.png" class="fellowspage">Brian brought his prior experience with mapping and science to ProPublica's "[Losing Ground](http://projects.propublica.org/louisiana/)," a project documenting erosion of the coastline in Louisiana. He dove into a [huge project](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/how-we-made-losing-ground/) to understand historical, satellite, and even [balloon-mapped](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/reporting-youngest-land-earth/) imagery and then figure out how to make it accessible and understandable to readers.

###Mark Boas - 2012 fellow, now at Hyperaudio
<img src="/media/img/fellows/mark_small.jpg" class="fellowspage">Mark came to the fellowship with a wealth of experience with online audio and video. This was a great fit for interactive projects at Al Jazeera as well as efforts to add better navigation and captioning support to news events like the [2012 U.S. presidential debates](http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/interactive/2012/10/20121023134433218846.html).

## Collaborate
Working together is at the heart of open source development and fellows have the chance to combine forces with their newsroom colleagues, the other fellows in their cohort, the wider journalism-code community, and beyod.

###Kavya Sukumar - current fellow at Vox Media

<img src="/media/img/fellows/2015-fellows/kavya60.jpg" class="fellowspage">Kavya and colleagues on the Vox Product team open sourced [Autotune](https://github.com/voxmedia/autotune/), a tool to make it easier to create templates for things like  quizzes and charts. Vox had been using the tool internally, and with Kavya's help they were able [to share  it](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/introducing-autotune/) so other orgs can use it, too.

###Manuel Aristarán - 2013 fellow, now at MIT Civic Media<br>Mike Tigas - 2013 fellow, now at ProPublica
<img src="/media/img/fellows/manuel_small.jpg" class="fellowspage"><img src="/media/img/fellows/mike.jpg" class="fellowspage">Manuel and Mike worked on the tricky problem of extracting tabular data from PDFs. Manuel began work on Tabula prior to his fellowship and continued its development while at La Nacion in partnership with ProPublica. Mike, his ProPublica colleague Jeremy B. Merrill, and Manuel [launched TabulaPDF](http://tabula.technology/) in 2013 and have continued its development.

###Gabriela Rodriguez - 2014 fellow, now at The Coral Project
<img src="/media/img/fellows/2014-fellows/gabriela-60.png" class="fellowspage">Gabriela picked up the work of her predecessor at La Nacion, Manuel Aristarán, to create an [open source tool for crowdsourcing analysis of PDF documents](https://github.com/crowdata/crowdata). The open source project also involved "checkathon" events where readers and university students could participate by checking the documents and logging the relevant details, no coding required.

## Share
A handful of individuals get to spend 10 months as a fellow, but by documenting, speaking, and teaching about their work, fellows expand the reach of their efforts and allow the rest of the journalism-code community to benefit from their work.

###Francis Tseng and Tara Adiseshan - current fellows at The Coral Project
<img src="/media/img/fellows/2015-fellows/francis60.jpg" class="fellowspage"><img src="/media/img/fellows/2015-fellows/tara60.jpg" class="fellowspage">
Francis and Tara joined [The Coral Project](coralproject.net) and got straight to work on research. They immersed themselves in learning about how communities interact online and what communities outside of news may be able to teach news sites. Francis and Tara have shared their research at the New York Times and at events including the Allied Media Conference and SRCCON.

###Harlo Holmes - 2014 fellow, now at Freedom of the Press Foundation<br>Aurelia Moser - 2014 fellow, now at CartoDB
<img src="/media/img/fellows/2014-fellows/harlo-60.png" class="fellowspage"><img src="/media/img/fellows/2014-fellows/aurelia-60.png" class="fellowspage">Harlo and Aurelia wanted to help journalists understand how and why to communicate securely with sources. Harlo brought her extensive experience in the security community and Aurelia brought her curiosity about apps and communication to develop several talks about [opsec for journalists](https://github.com/auremoser/dropitlike/blob/master/README.md). They presented together, alongside Barton Gellman at HOPE, and at the Hacks/Hackers Buenos Aires Media Party.

###Brian Abelson - 2013 fellow, now freelancing
<img src="/media/img/fellows/brian_small.jpg" class="fellowspage">Brian brought his statistics background to studying analytics and impact throughout his fellowship at the New York Times. This led to a Tow Center fellowship where, along with Michael Keller and Stijn Debrouwere (2013 fellow at The Guardian) Brian continued his research. In 2015, Brian and Michael [released a major white paper](http://towcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Tow_Center_NewsLynx_Full_Report.pdf) and [open sourced their work](http://newslynx.readthedocs.org/) on NewsLynx.
