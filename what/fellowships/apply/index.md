<h2>{{ page.title }}</h2>

Thank you for your interest in the Knight-Mozilla Fellowships. Unfortunatley, we are no longer accepting applications for our 2016 fellowship cohort. We'll be announcing our 2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellows at the [Mozilla Festival, November 6-8 in London](https://2015.mozillafestival.org/).

If you're interested in learning more about [what we do at OpenNews](/what), or how to [get further involved](/what/community/) in the journalism-code community, feel free to explore this site or join one of our [open community calls](/what/community/calls/).

Thanks so much!
