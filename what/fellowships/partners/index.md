<p class="bodybig"> Fellowship partners host fellows for 10 months, offering challenging projects and immersion into the culture of the newsroom. We select partners who are invested in open source development and who will encourage their fellow to collaborate within and outside of their news organization.</p>
<p>The fellowship will be on hiatus for 2017. During early 2017, we're going to reflect on the past five years of the program and determine what shape the fellowship could take going forward. If you'd like to learn more about that or be notified when we have updates about the program please <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeFQ4WhSW5r9-t-Ai9DDUXRQLfyuC3PHZaUuZV-M23tpRHd2g/viewform">sign up here</a>.</p>

<!--### Working with a fellow
Hosting a fellow is different from adding another member to the team. Fellows collaborate with newsroom technology teams working on projects that are both editorial and technical. But fellows also have the chance to collaborate  with other folks in the newsroom, with the other fellows in their cohort, and wider journalism-code community. Fellowship partners provide a homebase for fellows and continuity of work and connection, while also leaving room for exploration. Fellows and their newsroom partners work together to decide on projects to work on before their fellowship,  with the support of OpenNews. They also leave ample room for those ideas  evolving over the course of the fellowship.-->

### Partnering with OpenNews
Being  a fellowship partner is the most intensive way that OpenNews  collaborates with news organizations, but it is just one of [many ways  that we partner](/getinvolved/newspartners/) with news orgs. Through our website Source and events like SRCCON, we  partner with news organizations and their teams to share their work. We  also host events called code convenings to help teams open source  projects.
