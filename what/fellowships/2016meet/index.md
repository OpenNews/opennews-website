<p class="bodybig">The 2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellows—our <em>fifth</em> cohort of fellows—come from inside and outside of journalism to spend 10 months working with tech teams within our fellowship partner organizations. This year, our fellows will work with the Los Angeles Times Data Desk, NPR, Vox Media,  Frontline, Correct!v, and the Coral Project (a collaboration between the New York  Times, the  Washington Post, and Mozilla).</p>

<h3 id="nicky">Nicky Case | Frontline</h3>
<p>Nicky Case plays with play. They make interactive explanations, to help people understand the world, and interactive stories, to help people understand themselves. Last year, Nicky made Coming Out Simulator, an autobiographical interactive story about their experience coming out as queer. It was nominated for Best Narrative at the 2015 Independent Games Festival. After that, they made a few interactives to explain math, psychology, and sociology. Most notably, they collaborated with Vi Hart to make Parable of the Polygons, a playable blog post about bias and diversity. Nicky still thinks writing about oneself in the third person is really weird. They’ll join the team at Frontline.

<h3 id="pietro">Pietro Passarelli | Vox</h3>
<p>Pietro Passarelli is a software developer and documentary filmmaker. He is passionate about projects that sit at the intersection between software development and video production, both in terms of the growing trend of interactive documentaries but also as tools for making video production and post-production easier, such as [autoEdit](http://pietropassarelli.com/autoEdit.html). While working in broadcast documentaries for BBC and C4 Pietro noticed the convergence of video production and software development and did an MSc in Computer Science at UCL. Recently, he worked as newsroom developer at the Times & Sunday Times where he developed [quickQuote](http://times.github.io/quickQuote/) an open-source project to make it easier and faster for journalists to identify and create an interactive video quote. Pietro will join the team at Vox Media.
