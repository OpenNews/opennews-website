<p class="bodybig">At OpenNews, we build <em>with</em> our community, not simply <em>for</em> it. OpenNews was created to support, strengthen, and expand the the community around open source code in journalism. Whether you’re part of an established news apps or data team, or brand new to the field, we have programs and resources to help you connect with peers and mentors, share your work, and make more fantastic projects.</p>

### [Share Your Work](http://source.opennews.org)

From visualization libraries to data extractors and presentation templates, newsrooms are creating some of the most exciting code on the internet right now. We highlight that work on [Source](http://source.opennews.org), our website dedicated to the code in journalism and the people who write it. On Source, news organizations share the code, process, and thinking behind news applications and interactives. The resources on the site are a direct result of the generosity and efforts of the developers, designers, and newsrooms who are willing to show their work. Join them by [sharing your contributions](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/contribute/) today.

### [Build Together at Convenings](/what/conferences/convenings)

OpenNews [Code, Culture, and Leadership convenings](/what/conferences/convenings) are cohort-driven events where small groups come together to work and problem solve related to a common theme.  Code convening teams open-source newsroom code and build new applications and libraries to address journalistic problems. Modeled off of our Code Convenings program, in 2017 the format will expand to include topics beyond code. [Learn more about how to participate](/what/conferences/convenings).
