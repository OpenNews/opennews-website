  <h1 class="big-type">Resource packs for how journalists can rethink our relationship with work during a global pandemic</h1>
  <h2 class="dek"><em>For the humans working at or leading news organizations, a curated list of shared resources by OpenNews</em></h2>

  <p>Working from home during a global crisis isn’t the same as working from home any other day. This is especially true for journalists and news organizations as we try to help people make sense of a crisis while experiencing crisis ourselves. It’s extra stress, extra exhaustion, extra juggling, combined with extra hours. Many of us started working from home overnight — <a href="https://blog.alicegoldfuss.com/work-in-the-time-of-corona/">it’s okay to feel overwhelmed, anxious, distracted.</a> </p>

  <p>We’ve seen lots of great guides on how to work home (we share some favorites later!). But this guide is based on our shared values as a community, meant to help answer some of the most essential questions, matched with the best resources we could find to help you answer them thoughtfully and empathetically.</p>

  <p>Our questions and paired resources are split into three sections:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><a href="#everyone">Questions that apply to everyone trying to work through a global pandemic</a></li>
    <li><a href="#for-editors-and-managers">Questions especially for editors and managers who are trying to lead thoughtfully during this overwhelming time</a></li>
    <li><a href="#general-guidance">General resources about working from home that we’ve found the most helpful</a></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Pick and choose based on what you need most. If there are essential resources and questions you think should be here, we want to add them! Email us at <a href="mailto:team@opennews.org">team@opennews.org</a>.</p>

<h2>COVID&#8211;19 changed <em>everything</em> — How do I adapt? How do we adapt together?</h2>

<p>Our community has been encouraging newsrooms to <a href="https://etherpad.opennews.org/p/covid-resource-faq">get more comfortable with remote work</a> for a while now—through planning and purpose, though, not a choice made for us by a pandemic. Now many of us are suddenly working from home without all the support we need, in a shared space that wasn&#8217;t designed for our jobs, communicating through a whole new set of cues. This is a time to redefine how we imagine productivity and to be there for each other with grace.</p>

<p>The boundaries between our personal and professional lives are also more porous than usual right now. If you can, let who you are, where you are, and what you love spill into work—not the other way around. When your cat wanders into frame or one of your kids marches in through the home-office door during a video call, your colleagues won’t mind. <a href="https://twitter.com/thebestsophist/status/1239935827830071296">They’ll celebrate</a>.</p>

<p class="question-section"><strong>PHYSICAL WORKSPACE &amp; WORKING WITH OTHERS</strong></p>

<p class="question"><strong>My partner and I are trying to balance working from home with taking care of the kids—how do we make this easier?</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;A long time ago — like, last week — we would have talked about setting up a home workspace and setting personal schedules. But this is a new world now. For so many of us, schools are closed. Day cares are closed. If you have a partner, that person is either also home figuring out this new reality (and taking up precious desk space), or is working extra long hours as a result of these new circumstances.&#8221; </p>

<h2>How do I lead as thoughtfully as possible?</h2>

<p>Make sure you’re not <a href="https://aworkinglibrary.com/writing/hard-way">conflating two key points</a>: working from home vs. working in physical isolation during a global pandemic. Both are happening simultaneously and your team will continue to experience lots of changes — both at work and at home — all while leaning harder on tools some of them have only used somewhat before. Be <a href="https://twitter.com/chrisalbon/status/1239927980450697218">“massively empathetic”</a> and let that guide you through the rest.</p>

<ul>
<li>“We will assume positive intent. These are hard times. Everyone is going through tough personal situations and stressors. This can cause folks to lash out in frustration or fear.
