<title>How We Facilitated a Huge, Participatory, Highly Charged SRCCON Session, a Guest Post from Alyson Hurt</title>
<dc:creator></dc:creator>

<description>As the SRCCON organizers reminded us, our job was to *facilitate* a session, and our topic in particular felt like it was meant to be a conversation (rather than, say, a skill-share or lesson). We had some thoughts and past experience to share, but we by no means considered ourselves experts. In a group setting, we could all learn from *each other* about ways—as individuals, as managers, as teams, as organizations—folks are dealing with burnout and job satisfaction now, and maybe devise new strategies to try in the future.</description>

<dc:creator></dc:creator>

<description>If you've never presented at a conference with facilitators instead of speakers before, you're in for a treat.
