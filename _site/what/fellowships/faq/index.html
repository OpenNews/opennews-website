<h2>The Knight-Mozilla Fellowships&colon; The Search Process</h2>
<p class="bodybig">The 2016 <a href="/what/fellowships/2016meet">2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellows</a> completed their fellowships in January 2017. The fellowship is [on hiatus](/fellowships/info) for 2017.

<!--We&#8217;ll have plenty of information here about what to expect in the process when then application opens. If you want to get a head start, here&#8217;s some info about <a href="/blog/fellowships-final-week-two/">what to consider in your application</a>.</p>
<p class="bodybig">The <a href="/what/fellowships/apply">application to become a 2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellow</a> is open until August  21, 2015. Here's what to expect throughout this process.</p>

### BEFORE YOU APPLY
We're really interested in getting to know you and why you want to become a fellow. The application is kept short and is all about you--no need to track down recommendation letters or contact info for old bosses. Here are some additional details about the application and selection process.

#### How to prepare
Reading this site is a great start. We've tried to answer questions we expect you might have, but if you have additional questions you can check out a live [question and answer session](https://etherpad.mozilla.org/opennews-calls-Aug5) on a community call, or [email us](mailto:info@opennnews.org).

To complete the application, gather a few examples of your work and think about why you want to do the fellowship.

* **For your work examples, tell us about projects you're proud of.** We want to hear why you’re excited about those projects and learn about how you approached them. The examples don't need to be flashy. We're interested in learning about your interests and skills, not in critiquing your work.
* **If you don't have open-source projects, that's ok!** If you can show us a screenshot or some other way of sharing a project, that's great. Many of our fellows did not have  open-source contributions either. Note: The examples you include on the application are not shared beyond the small pool of application reviewers.
* **In the free-response questions, just tell us about yourself.** Really. It's totally fine if you have no previous journalism experience. It's ok if you're self-taught and still building your coding skills--that describes several of our fellows, too. We really do want to get to know you, and the questions are straightforward, not tricks. If you're not sure how to interpret a question, [you can ask us](mailto:info@opennews.org), or just try your best.

#### Send us your application
Once you've answered all your questions, it's time to complete and [submit the application](/what/fellowships/apply). If you're still unsure, apply. If you've applied before and were not accepted, apply.

Each year, we get more applications from  amazingly qualified candidates than we are able to accept as fellows, but that does not mean we  wouldn’t love to work with those candidates. The needs of the [fellowship partner news organizations](/what/fellowships/partners) change from year to year, so it becomes a different selection process every year. And that means that sometimes someone who was not selected as a fellow one year, becomes a fellow the  next. 2015 fellow Kavya Sukumar wrote about [her experience getting the fellowship](http://blog.kavyasukumar.com/third-time-is-the-charm/), on her third try.

The only way to become a fellow [is to apply](/what/fellowships/apply). And it's a great way for us, and the partner news organizations, to get to know you for future opportunities as well.

### AFTER THE DEADLINE CLOSES
Applications are submitted through a Screendoor form and are visible at the time they are submitted, but formal review does not begin until after the application deadline closes on August 21.
#### Initial review
* OpenNews staff review all of the applications and cull the batch to a manageable number for the fellowship partners to review.
* The fellowship partners review this shorter list and submit a list of the five people they are most interested in learning more about.
* These semifinalists are contacted for interviews. Applicants who are not moving forward in the selection process are notified.

#### Semifinalists
* Our director, Dan Sinker, and program manager, Erika Owens, conduct short, standardized interviews with the  semifinalists, asking a few questions that are about vision and  skills/practical considerations. This year, [based on guidance from David Eads at NPR](http://blog.apps.npr.org/2015/07/20/how-to-apply.html), we will send the list of questions to semifinalists in advance, so that they can prepare.
* The notes from these interviews are submitted back to the news  partners for review, and the news partners are able to pick their top  three finalists from the entire pool of semifinalists, not just the five  they initially submitted. (Last year there was a lot of crossover at  this stage.)

#### Finalists
* The news organization and OpenNews have a much longer interview with  each of that news organization’s top three candidates. This interview is a chance for the fellowship partner and the finalist to learn more about each other and what to expect from a fellowship at that news organization.
* OpenNews and the fellowship partners consult before the final fellow selection is made for each news organization.

#### Notifying the fellows
* The selected fellows are notified and given an opportunity to ask additional questions of the fellowship partner and OpenNews.
* The finalists and semifinalists that were not selected as fellows are notified of their application status.

### ANNOUNCING THE FELLOWS
We  will announce the fellows at the [Mozilla Festival in London](https://2015.mozillafestival.org/) on November  6-8. For this announcement, we bring all of the fellows to London, and representatives of each of the news organizations join us there. It is a chance for the fellows to meet each other in person, meet their news  partner, and get to know more about Mozilla's work supporting the open web and how journalism fits into that work.!-->
