I"µ<p>In two short days, weâ€™ll close the session-proposal window for <a href="http://srccon.org/">SRCCON, our annual conference for newsroom developers, designers, and data analysts</a>. Every year, the deadline comes up faster than seems possible, but itâ€™s not yet too lateâ€”in fact, this is the <em>perfect</em> time to <a href="http://srccon.org/sessions/pitch/">submit your pitch</a>.</p>

<p>But why pitch a session, anyway? In case youâ€™re on the fence, we put together a few quick reasons why you should stop dithering and send that pitch in.</p>

<p>You should pitch a SRCCON session becauseâ€¦</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Leading a session is the best way to get productively immersed in a highly participatory conference like SRCCON.</strong> As a session leader, youâ€™ll necessarily meet a ton of great people and learn huge amounts, both during prep for your session and especially in the session itself.</li>
  <li><strong>Running (or co-running) a SRCCON session is a fantastic, low-risk way to get more comfortable in a leadership role, and with public speaking.</strong> Our sessions are hands-on and peer-to-peer, so theyâ€™re much less intimidating to lead than a traditional lecture-style conference talkâ€”itâ€™s more like running a work session with amazing colleagues. If you put in the work to plan a great session, no oneâ€™s going to care if youâ€™re a polished speaker or a little nervous, and everyone in the room will be rooting for you.</li>
  <li><strong>We do everything we can to support the work of session facilitation</strong>, because session leaders are at the very center of what makes SRCCON tick. As a session leader, youâ€™ll have a guaranteed chance to buy a ticketâ€”and as much guidance and support as youâ€™d like from our team as you plan your approach to the session. Session leadership also gives you an advantage if you apply for a travel scholarship, so if youâ€™ll need financial support to get to SRCCON, itâ€™s definitely worthwhile to pitch a session.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="but-how">But How?</h3>

<p>So letâ€™s say youâ€™re convincedâ€”itâ€™s time to send in a pitch. But how to do it? Start with these three easy steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Pick an idea.</strong> Any hard question or problem you find interesting will probably interest someone else at SRCCONâ€”likely a lot of someone elses. Now consider narrowing your focus a bit, because the best session ideas are usually pretty specific, and the allotted time for any given session goes by fast.</li>
  <li><strong>Plan your approach.</strong> Would your topic be best as a hands-on skillshare session? Or a small-group-style discussion? Or maybe a game? As long as your session is participatory (not a lecture), your format options are nearly limitless. Check out the links below for ideas and sketch a basic plan.</li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://srccon.org/sessions/pitch/">Send in the pitch!</a></strong> This part is super-easy, but donâ€™t forget to do it <strong>before midnight Pacific Time on April 20</strong>. If youâ€™d like to co-lead your session, you can tell us on your proposal and either give us your co-leaderâ€™s name or ask us for help finding the right person.</li>
</ul>
