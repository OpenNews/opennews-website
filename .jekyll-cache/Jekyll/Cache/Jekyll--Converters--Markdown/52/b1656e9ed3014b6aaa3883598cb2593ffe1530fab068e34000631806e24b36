I"”<p>Organic growth produces the most beautiful forms: branching coral, feathery green ferns, spiral seashells. It makes terrible websites, though.</p>

<p>As our programs have increased in number, scale, and scope, weâ€™ve found ourselves hitting the usual signs of an outgrown siteâ€”sprawling navigation, findability problems, and trouble tracking which content is out of date. So <a href="http://opennews.org/blog/introducing-kavya/">while our 2015 Knight-Mozilla fellows have been in Los Angeles</a>, getting to know each other and the world of newsroom code, weâ€™ve given OpenNews.org a haircut and re-org to reflect the work weâ€™re actually doing. Youâ€™ll still find comprehensive info on the <a href="http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/">fellowships</a>, and a lot more detail about our <a href="http://opennews.org/what/conferences/">two annual conferences</a> and the broad range of <a href="http://opennews.org/what/community/">code and community support work</a> we do, including <a href="http://opennews.org/what/community/source/">Source</a>, <a href="http://opennews.org/what/conferences/convenings/">code convenings</a>, and our <a href="http://opennews.org/what/community/calls/">open community calls</a>.</p>

<p>As always, weâ€™re working in the open, so <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/mozilla-opennews">the siteâ€™s up on GitHub</a>, and we welcome your comments, bug reports, and pull requests.</p>
