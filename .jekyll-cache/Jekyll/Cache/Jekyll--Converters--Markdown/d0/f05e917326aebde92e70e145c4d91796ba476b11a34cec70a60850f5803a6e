<p>One question we hear a lot in the leadup to SRCCON is ‚Äúwhat kind of session proposals are you looking for this year?‚Äù And it‚Äôs a great thing to ask! But also so hard to answer. The truth is, we don‚Äôt have a secret list of topics‚Äînot even tucked away in our brains somewhere‚Äîthat we feel like HAVE to be on the SRCCON program.</p>

<p>That‚Äôs because we see SRCCON session proposals as one of the ways we can really listen to how this community‚Äôs priorities are evolving and growing. One of the best ways, in fact, and the themes that emerge from your session ideas don‚Äôt just shape the SRCCON program. They inform decisions we make, experiments we try, and priorities we set throughout the year.</p>

<p>Listening makes sure SRCCON is a responsive conference. Instead of a checklist of topics, we have animating values for the space we create together. You‚Äôll see themes thread their way through all of our programs: Peer learning. Doing journalism as a human. Inclusion, representation, and equity. Organizational change. Tech, ethics, and creativity. It‚Äôs no coincidence that the structure around the SRCCON schedule is built to support those themes, too, with space for building relationships, bringing our full selves into conversation, and preparing each other to take what we learn and put it into practice.</p>

<p>We want to make it as easy as possible for you to join us in Minneapolis, so our <a href="https://srccon.org/participation/form/">call for participation form</a> is open till April 24 to collect your session proposals, apply for a scholarship, or just tell us that you‚Äôd like to attend. We‚Äôve also got a <a href="https://srccon.org/sessions/proposal-guide/">proposal guide</a> and <a href="/blog/srccon2019-participation-howto/">CFP walkthrough</a> to help you think through how to approach the form, and if you‚Äôre curious about what sessions to pitch (or the types of sessions you might encounter at SRCCON!), we‚Äôve collected some of the themes we‚Äôve noticed.</p>

<h2 id="so-how-do-you-figure-out-what-kind-of-session-to-propose">So how <em>do</em> you figure out what kind of session to propose?</h2>

<p>In five-plus years of running this conference, we‚Äôve learned that it takes two things for a session idea to come together in the most compelling way: A subject that‚Äôs deeply important to you as a session leader, and an experience that draws participants in.</p>

<p>The first part, well, it really <em>is</em> up to you. Creating a participatory experience is something we can help with. We support facilitators throughout their planning process, and we‚Äôre intentional in inviting an audience that represents all kinds of backgrounds and experiences. Good sessions end up being about listening as much as learning. The people in the room are colleagues and contributors.</p>

<p>And just like SRCCON is built around a set of values, crafting a session that operates like that usually starts with a values statement itself. Here are some shorthand ways to describe sessions that we‚Äôve seen connect with the community over and over again:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>‚ÄúWe were the news nerds on this project, and here‚Äôs why that was so important.‚Äù</strong> People working at the intersection of journalism and tech are uniquely positioned to lead, and they make a newsroom‚Äôs most innovative and engaging work possible.</li>
  <li><strong>‚ÄúThe journalism we do is missing THIS, but we can make it better.‚Äù</strong> Important conversations at SRCCON put the needs of people at the center‚Äîthe people doing the work as well as the people we‚Äôre doing it for.</li>
  <li><strong>‚ÄúOur newsrooms need to change. Let‚Äôs start with THIS.‚Äù</strong> The people at this conference are pushing journalism to become more inclusive and equitable, inside our organizations and in relationship with the communities we cover.</li>
  <li><strong>‚ÄúJournalism is hard‚Äîbut THIS makes it easier to work together.‚Äù</strong> From building healthy teams to breaking out of organizational silos, we have a LOT to learn by sharing what works (and doesn‚Äôt).</li>
  <li><strong>‚ÄúJournalism is hard‚Äîhow can we do it as real, complicated people?‚Äù</strong> SRCCON makes room for sessions that elevate our professional practice, side by side with frank conversations about the lives we bring into this work.</li>
  <li><strong>‚ÄúI learned how to do something cool, and I can teach you how to do it too.‚Äù</strong> We don‚Äôt look for starter sessions like, say, an HTML primer or a scraping tutorial‚Äîthose are super important, but conferences like NICAR already do them SO WELL. At SRCCON we look for technical sessions that push at the edges of what a ‚Äúlab‚Äù might look like, and these skill-building sessions are best when they‚Äôre rooted in examples from your own work.</li>
</ul>

<p>These approaches (and many others!) are built around values, and they‚Äôre intentionally open to all kinds of topics that you find meaningful‚Äîtake a look through our previous schedules and you‚Äôll see them everywhere. They work because SRCCON is participatory. Session facilitators work <em>with</em> participants, and participants show up with their own experience and expertise to share.</p>

<p>So we aren‚Äôt kidding about not having a list of ideas in mind. Some might carry forward from previous SRCCONs and other events, others will be new for 2019, and if you‚Äôve never seen it on a journalism conference schedule before, that‚Äôs a session pitch we want to read. Individual passions and interests are what make SRCCON such an exciting, transformative experience, and what makes it a true joy to read so many proposals every year. We hope we get to read one of yours this time.</p>

<p><em>The <a href="https://srccon.org/participation/form/">SRCCON 2019 call for participation form</a> is open through April 24, and all session proposers will hear back from us by May 10. As space remains available, we will keep the call for participation open for tickets only after the April 24 deadline, but applying by that date is your best chance to attend and your only chance to pitch a session or apply for a scholarship. If you‚Äôd like to talk through a session idea as it takes shape, please reach out!
