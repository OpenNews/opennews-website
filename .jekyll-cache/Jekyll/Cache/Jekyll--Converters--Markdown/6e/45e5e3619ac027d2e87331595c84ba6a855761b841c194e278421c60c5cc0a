<p>Members of the OpenNews team are in Jacksonville this week for <a href="http://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar2017/">NICAR 2017</a> for a great conference and to share a bunch of info and resources. We’re so excited to join hundreds of other journalists, techies, data lovers, and good old fashioned computer-assisted reporters to learn, share, vent, and enjoy four days together.</p>

<p>We’ve got some stuff to share at NICAR too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>We’ve announced the call for proposal and ticket dates for <a href="https://srccon.org/">SRCCON</a>: the CFP opens on March 22 and closes April 7, and our ticket lottery opens April 26 and closes May 8</li>
  <li>We’re sponsoring the NICAR Conversations track again this year, and you can find all the sessions on the NICAR schedule as well as in <a href="https://public.etherpad-mozilla.org/p/opennews-2017-NICAR-conversations-schedule">this handy etherpad</a> (Thanks so much to track co-organizers Brittany Mayes and David Eads from NPR!)</li>
  <li>We’re going to release the results of the <a href="/blog/news-nerd-survey/">first news nerd survey</a> on Thursday afternoon (thanks to all of you who contributed)</li>
  <li>We’re releasing a field guide to open source in the newsroom (including contributions from more than 20 community members). You can find out all about the field guide at a NICAR Conversation on Friday at 10:15am, where Lindsay, Ryan, and Erin will facilitate a discussion about open source in journalism</li>
</ul>

<p>Plus, we’re bringing 25 community members who received OpenNews <a href="/what/community/scholarships">Ticket+Travel Scholarships</a> to attend NICAR and our <a href="/what/fellowships/2016meet">2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellows</a>. We’re excited to be in town as well! Feel free to ping <a href="mailto:erika@opennews.org">Erika</a>, <a href="ryan@opennews.org">Ryan</a>, <a href="erin@opennews.org">Erin</a>, or <a href="lindsay@opennews.org">Lindsay</a> or wave us down and say hi. Dan <a href="https://twitter.com/dansinker/status/836998256345366528">sends his regrets and best wishes</a> from Chicago. You can also tweet <a href="https://twitter.com/opennews">@OpenNews</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/source">@Source</a>, or <a href="https://twitter.com/SRCCON">@SRCCON</a> if you want to reach us as well.</p>

<p>We’re so grateful to IRE for creating this space for folks from newsrooms around the world to come together to share, and that is supported by <a href="http://www.ire.org/media/uploads/files/documents/ire_principles.pdf">IRE’s principles</a>. Looking forward to hallway discussions, tasty food, and great conversations.</p>
