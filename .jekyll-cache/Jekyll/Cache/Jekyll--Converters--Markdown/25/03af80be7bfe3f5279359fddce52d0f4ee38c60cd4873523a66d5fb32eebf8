<h2>Source&#058;  Journalism Code, Community &amp; Context</h2>
<p class="bodybig">The code emerging from newsrooms drives innovation across the web, and the community writing it is talented, dedicated, and growing fast. Our community hub, <a href="http://source.opennews.org">Source</a> spotlights that community and dives deep into the code it&#8217;s making.</p>

<h3 id="the-context-behind-the-code">The Context Behind the Code</h3>

<p>No code is written in a vacuum, and that’s especially true in journalism, where the news of the day influences the lines of code written to research, report, and interpret it. <a href="http://source.opennews.org/articles/">Our pieces</a> connect the code with its context, using the journalistic approach of “Who, What, Why, When, and How” to exploring the motivations, ideas, and innovations behind the lines of code.</p>

<p>We’ve built the shape of the community into the very <a href="https://github.com/OpenNews/opennews-source">source code</a> of Source itself, collecting data around <a href="http://source.opennews.org/people">people</a> and <a href="http://source.opennews.org/organizations">organizations</a> with every article we write and every line of code we index. You can learn more about the creators of journalism’s vital codebases right alongside the code they’ve written.</p>
