<p><a href="http://srccon.org">SRCCON is back in 2015</a> for another two days of building better newsroom code, culture, and process, this time in beautiful Minneapolis. The conference will take place June 25 and 26, and tickets go on sale April 29.</p>

<p>Most importantly, <a href="http://srccon.org/sessions/">we are accepting session proposals through April 10</a>. Whether you attended last yearâ€™s SRCCON or not, this is the perfect chance to get involved and bring conversations on topics you care about into the heart of this yearâ€™s event. Session faciliators donâ€™t bring slides and arenâ€™t expected to deliver prepared talksâ€”instead, weâ€™re looking for sessions designed around small-group conversation, hands-on skillshares, collaborative designing and building, or other formats that get attendees thinking, talking, and making together.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ve posted links to <a href="http://srccon.org/sessions/#examples">a few excellent sessions from last year</a>â€”though there were far more than we could fit into a short list, so you can also check out the whole 2014 program. Right now, this yearâ€™s proposals are rolling in and weâ€™re starting to <a href="http://srccon.org/sessions/proposals/">post them on the SRCCON website</a>.</p>

<h3 id="srccon-session-qa-and-office-hours">SRCCON Session Q&amp;A and Office Hours</h3>

<p>Our <a href="http://opennews.org/what/community/calls/">April 1 community call</a> will include a SRCCON session Q&amp;A, and weâ€™ll be holding virtual office hours on April 1 and 7 to help with proposals, answer questions, and provide general encouragement to everyone interested in proposing a session.
