<p>Iâ€™ve officially started as Director of Programs at OpenNews and I couldnâ€™t be more excited.</p>

<p>OpenNews has grown and evolved so much over the years and Iâ€™ve always cheered them on, consistently impressed and inspired by their ability to identify and act on the communityâ€™s needs and build programs that make a transformative difference. They <a href="https://opennews.org/blog/fellowship-what-next/">placed technologists into newsrooms</a> when journalism was just beginning to understand what programming could do for a newsroom. They created <a href="https://srccon.org/">SRCCON</a>, an interactive conference distinguished by its ability to enable real and urgent conversations that journalism is begging to have, and a conference that people <a href="https://labs.inn.org/2019/07/15/srccon-2019-a-first-timers-recap/">repeatedly say</a> creates the most <a href="https://www.poynter.org/tech-tools/2016/how-to-throw-an-intentional-inclusive-journalism-conference">safe and inclusive environment</a> that they have ever felt at a professional gathering. On top of that, OpenNews has worked to connect people in the community who often feel most isolated in their newsrooms â€” with <a href="https://opennews.org/what/community/scholarships/">scholarships</a> to underrepresented people in journalism, focused programming for <a href="https://ona19.journalists.org/sessions/24439132/">helping</a> <a href="https://opennews.org/blog/news-nerd-survey-2017/">journalists of color</a> <a href="https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-diversify-your-newsroom-starting-now/">change their newsrooms</a>, and <a href="https://opennews.org/what/community/datareview/">for local coders</a> scattered across the country, who are doing important work, but lack peers with similar skills in their organizations to support them.</p>

<p>For me, this transition feels like moving from working for one, amazing newsroom, to being able to work for all of journalism. And the idea of identifying and building programs to give the community what it needs when it needs it? Well, that feels like the work Iâ€™ve been doing my entire life.</p>

<p>Those of you who know me know that Iâ€™ve always been idealistic. When I can envision a way to change something for the better or to create something that should exist â€” whether thatâ€™s the best way to tell a story, a new program, or an improved way of doing things â€” I feel compelled and responsible for turning those visions into reality.</p>
