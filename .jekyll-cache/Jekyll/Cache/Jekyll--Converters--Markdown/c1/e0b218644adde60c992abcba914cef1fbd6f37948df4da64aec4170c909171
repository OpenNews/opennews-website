<h2>SRCCON Events</h2>

<p class="bodybig">SRCCON conferences are two days of community connection, collaborative sessions, and a ton of documentation. As one attendee put it, <em>‚ÄúThe structure of the program and the attention to detail and people‚Äôs needs is what makes this an exceptional and special event.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>We‚Äôve been hosting SRCCON events since 2014, and <a href="https://srccon.org/our-resources#participant-experience">have gathered years of writing</a> about how we create these inclusive, participatory spaces as well as session documentation, and resources that inspired us from the start. If you‚Äôd like to learn more about how we organize these events, and maybe have us help out with an event of your own, <a href="mailto:info@opennews.org">reach out</a>!</p>

<h2 id="srccon">SRCCON</h2>

<p><a href="https://srccon.org">SRCCON 2019</a> returns to Minneapolis on July 11 &amp; 12 and will include 300 participants who want to dig into challenging questions and discuss ways we can make newsroom tech teams, and journalism overall, work well for <em>everyone</em>.</p>

<p>Through these events, we see how much this community working at the intersection of journalism, technology, and social changes supports one another and pushes each other to implement more inclusive policies, and do more sustainable and interesting work.</p>

<h2 id="srcconpower">SRCCON:POWER</h2>

<p><a href="https://power.srccon.org/">SRCCON:POWER</a> in December 2018 was the second in a series of smaller, topic-focused convenings built on the SRCCON model of deep conversation and community connection. Participants engaged in conversations about how power influences our work at the intersection of journalism and technology, and one attendee shared that they walked away from the event with knowledge that <em>‚ÄúThere is a community in journalism that wants to reform power structures and it makes me feel heard and safe.‚Äù</em></p>

<p>The conversations, feedback, and challenges <a href="/blog/srccon-power-reflect/">raised during SRCCON:POWER</a> have influenced OpenNews‚Äô work into 2019 and beyond.</p>
