We highlight that work on <a href="http://source.opennews.org">Source</a>, our website dedicated to the code in journalism and the people who write it.

<h3 id="build-together-at-convenings"><a href="/what/conferences/convenings">Build Together at Convenings</a></h3>

<p>OpenNews <a href="/what/conferences/convenings">Code, Culture, and Leadership convenings</a> are cohort-driven events where small groups come together to work and problem solve related to a common theme.  Code convening teams open-source newsroom code and build new applications and libraries to address journalistic problems. Modeled off of our Code Convenings program, in 2017 the format will expand to include topics beyond code. <a href="/what/conferences/convenings">Learn more about how to participate</a>.</p>
