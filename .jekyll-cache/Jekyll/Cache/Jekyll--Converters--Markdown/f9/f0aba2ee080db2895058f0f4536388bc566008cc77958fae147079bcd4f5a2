I"n<p><a href="http://www.coralproject.net">The Coral Project</a> is building an open-source content and commenting platform. It will allow audiences to more deeply engage with media coverage and help news organizations everywhere better manage user comments and contributions.</p>

<p>The project <a href="http://www.knightfoundation.org/press-room/press-release/mozilla-new-york-times-and-washington-post-launch-/">was announced in June 2014</a>. It is being created by a new group made up of staff from Knight-Mozilla OpenNews, The New York Times, and The Washington Post, and funded by a grant from the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.</p>

<p>Since the announcement, exciting things have been happening at the Coral Project (now tweeting <a href="https://twitter.com/coralproject">@coralproject</a>), and we thought you should know about them.</p>

<p>###Introducing our Project Lead: Andrew Losowsky</p>

<p>We’re excited today to announce our first dedicated Coral Project hire, Andrew Losowsky. Andrew ensures that everything we make is focused on the needs of publishers and audiences. He will be working closely with our development team to maintain the vision and the integrity of the project.</p>

<p>We have to do more than build a better comment box. The Coral Project needs to be free to think big, to experiment, and to learn as we go. Andrew’s previous work shows that he isn’t afraid of ambition and innovation.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.losowsky.com">Andrew’s background</a> is in both editorial and product. He’s worked on new content and data visualization projects at News Corp, developed journalism and strategy at The Huffington Post, and in 2013 was awarded a John S. Knight Fellow at Stanford University. He has written for <em>The Guardian</em>, <em>The Wall Street Journal</em>, and <em>The Times</em> of London among many other publications. For four years, he was Editorial Director of le cool, a publishing start up based in Barcelona, Spain, and has written and edited books on editorial design, independent magazines, infographics, and doorbells.</p>

<p>He is currently an Adjunct Professor in the Journalism+Design program at The New School in New York City, where he teaches Stealth Journalism.</p>

<p>Andrew is now your go-to person for more information about the project. You can <a href="mailto:andrewl@mozillafoundation.org">email him</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/losowsky">follow him on Twitter</a>.</p>
