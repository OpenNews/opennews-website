<p>This week is the <a href="https://ire.org/conferences/nicar18/">2018 National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting</a> conference, and the whole OpenNews team will be in Chicago for great sessions and conversation. Weâ€™re looking forward to spending the week with hundreds of other journalilsts, tech folks, data lovers, and computer-assisted reporters to learn and share together.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re helping out with a few events where weâ€™d love to see you:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Thursday, March 8 at 6pm</strong> City Bureauâ€™s Public Newsroom this week will host a chat about the Chicago Civic Data Collaborative, and weâ€™re happy to sponsor the coffee. <a href="https://www.facebook.com/events/945664222264702/">Join us to learn more about the journalism and data communities in the city hosting us this week</a>.</li>
  <li><strong>Friday, March 9 at 8am</strong> Meet up with Erin Kissane and Lindsay Muscato from our site Source to join in nerd conversation. Weâ€™re gathering in the Knight Foundation space at the conferenceâ€”Armitage/Belmont, 4th floor.</li>
  <li><strong>Friday, March 9 at 7:30pm</strong> Community member Rachel Shorey organized this news nerd night at the Chicago Design Museum and weâ€™re so psyched to sponsor it. <a href="https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nicar-at-the-design-museum-tickets-43551891881">Please RSVP for a free spot at the museum, plus, snacks!</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In addition to these events, weâ€™re excited to help 19 community members get to NICAR as part of our <a href="/what/community/scholarships">Ticket + Travel scholarship program</a>. NICAR is always an exceptionally busy time and we canâ€™t wait for all the hallway conversations, sitting-room-only workshops, and more. During NICAR, weâ€™re going to be doing some needsfinding and planning related to our <a href="https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/2017/10/news-integrity-initiative-awards-1-8-million-build-support-quality-journalism/">News Integrity Intiative grant</a> as well as supporting small events for journalists of color and lonely coders.</p>
