<h2>What We Do</h2>

<p class="bodybig">At OpenNews, we believe that a community of peers working, learning and solving problems together can create a stronger, more representative, and ascendant journalism. We organize events and community supports to strengthen and sustain this ecosystem.</p>

<!--### [Fellowships](fellowships/)

The [Knight-Mozilla Fellowships](fellowships/) place developers, technologists, civic hackers, and data crunchers in 10-month paid fellowships to develop open-source projects in our partner newsrooms around the world. The 2016 cohort is our fifth group of Knight-Mozilla Fellows, and will be working with news technology teams at the Los Angeles Times, NPR, Vox Media, Correct!v, and the Coral Project (a partnership of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Mozilla).

<h3 id="gatherings"><a href="conferences/">Gatherings</a></h3>

<p>In-person events are an important way that this community shares its work, learns from one another, and grows as a network.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We host an <a href="conferences/srccon">annual conference called SRCCON</a>, back this year in Minneapolis. SRCCON is a hands-on conference focused on the practical challenges news technology and data teams encounter every day.</li>
  <li>We organize <a href="conferences/convenings">Code, Culture, and Leadership convenings</a> where small cohorts also have the opportunity to build peer groups and share expertise.</li>
  <li>At the <a href="conferences/mozfest">Mozilla Festival</a>, we wrangle a track of journalism sessions.</li>
  <li>Later this year, weâ€™ll hold our first smaller, topical mini-SRCCON.</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="conferences/">Learn more about the kinds of events we run and how to participate.</a></p>

<h3 id="community-support"><a href="community/">Community Support</a></h3>

<p>As this network matures, we have a slate of offerings to help share work and understand whatâ€™s happening in the journalism tech community.</p>

<ul>
  <li>In collaboration with writers and developers in newsrooms around the world, we publish <a href="community/source">Source, a community site</a> focused on open technology projects and process in journalism. From features that explore the context behind the code to targeted job listings that help the community expand, Source presents the people, projects, and insights behind journalism code.</li>
  <li>We also hold biweekly <a href="community/calls">Source community calls</a> where newsroom data and apps teams can share their work, announce job openings, and find collaborators.</li>
  <li>We offer <a href="community/scholarships">Ticket + Travel scholarships</a> to help community members attend events around the world.</li>
  <li>We conduct an annual survey to better understand this community and its needs.</li>
</ul>
