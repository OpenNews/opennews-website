<h2>The Knight-Mozilla Fellowships</h2>

<p class="bodybig">The Knight-Mozilla Fellowship placed creative technologists in newsrooms to work on open-source tools and support reporting that strengthens the web and changes people’s lives. From 2011-16, we placed 33 fellows with 19 news organizations in five countries.</p>

<p>###Impact and influence of the fellowship
Fellows came into to the program from many technical fields in and near journalism and after the fellowship 85% of them continued to work in journalism or adjacent fields.  During their terms, fellows worked on widely adopted tools, award-winning projects, graphics, research, and all the while writing and speaking and sharing about their work, ensuring that what they were learning could help other folks in their host newsrooms and beyond.</p>

<p>As one fellow put it, “everything I have done since the fellowship is directly related to my fellowship experience. Training workshops for journalists, organising journalism related events, journalism related projects.“ At the conclusion of the fellowship, the Knight Foundation <a href="https://www.knightfoundation.org/reports/opennews-insights-from-building-a-community-of-newsroom-technologists">conducted a study of the impact of the fellowship</a> and its development of a entire network of journalists supporting and training one another.</p>

<p>###Why a journalism-tech fellowship?
Journalism has a disproportionately strong influence on <a href="/blog/fellowships-open-web">the web we inhabit</a>. It shapes the web through code developed in newsrooms, like <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and <a href="http://backbonejs.org/">Backbone.js</a>. Journalism also works at an editorial scale few other industries can match—millions of readers engage with reporting every day, from stories that amuse to investigations and analysis that leads to meaningful changes in our communities.</p>

<p>By working in journalism, the Knight-Mozilla Fellows advocated for a web that is open, accessible, and ours. In journalism as in the open source community, openness is a core value—the information reporters uncover and share is critical to our ability to understand and affect our world. Knight-Mozilla Fellows became leaders in efforts to build tools and cultivate resources that enable news organizations to support healthy communities, online and off. <a href="/what/fellowships/info">Learn more about the structure of the program.</a></p>

<!--###The fellowship experience
Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend 10 months working with newsroom technology teams to write open-source code, analyze and visualize data, and explore tough problems facing journalism. Fellows have the [financial support](/what/fellowships/info) and time they need to explore journalism code, collaborate on open-source projects, and share their work at conferences around the world. In past years, [fellows have done](/what/fellowships/community/) research about security and analytics and built tools for extracting data from PDFs and crowdsourcing document analysis. They build strong relationships with the other fellows in their cohort as well as a growing community of alumni.

We embed fellows with a [partner news organization](/what/fellowships/partners) that provides space for the fellow, intriguing projects to work on, and an immersion into the culture of that newsroom. Fellows in 2016 will be placed with: the [Los Angeles Times Data Desk](http://www.latimes.com/local/datadesk/), [NPR](http://www.npr.org/), [Vox Media](http://www.voxmedia.com/), [Frontline](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/),  [Correct!v](https://correctiv.org/), and the [Coral Project](https://coralproject.net/) (a collaboration between the New York  Times, the  Washington Post, and Mozilla).

Learn more about the [financial and timing details](/what/fellowships/info) of the fellowship and the [application process](/what/fellowships/faq), which will open in mid-2016 for the 2017 cohort of fellows.

###Connecting a community

The Knight-Mozilla Fellows join a community that works at the intersection of journalism and technology. News developers and designers, civic hackers, and data crunchers build the stories and tools that help journalism thrive on the web. OpenNews, in turn, supports the fellows and other members of this community with programs and events including:

* [Source, a community hub](http://source.opennews.org) where the journalism code community writes about projects, code, and culture, posts jobs, and discusses emerging issues
* [SRCCON, our annual conference](/what/conferences/srccon) for people working on and around news technology teams
* Small-scale, focused [code convenings](/what/conferences/convenings) that assemble teams to polish, document, and release open source projects
* [Logistical and financial support for local events](/what/community/eventsupport) around the world

Fellows participate in this network at all levels, collaborating on projects, attending and speaking at events, reflecting on their work in Source, and building their profiles as contributors to the wider community.

The Knight-Mozilla Fellowship is one part of the networked approach of OpenNews. We connect and support the people and projects in the journalism code community to ensure that this work continues to flourish.-->
