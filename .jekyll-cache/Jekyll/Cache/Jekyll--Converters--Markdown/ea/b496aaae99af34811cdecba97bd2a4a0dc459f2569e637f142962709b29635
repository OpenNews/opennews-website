I"Ù<p>Weâ€™re excited to announce <a href="http://srccon.org">SRCCON 2015</a>, which will take place in Minneapolis, Minnesota on June 25 and 26. We canâ€™t wait to spend another two days building better newsroom code, culture, and processâ€”together.</p>

<p>SRCCON is centered around interactive, hands-on sessions and we will accept session proposals from March 18 to April 8. Tickets will go on sale April 29 and, if last year is any guide, they will sell out very quickly.
Last year was the inaugural SRCCON, and we had <a href="http://data.qz.com/srccon-daily-brief/">a ton</a> of <a href="https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/srccon-how-not-skew-data-statistics/">informative sessions</a>, and <a href="http://code.minnpost.com/ravenclaw/">fun evening events</a>. We expect to have much of the same camaraderie and good food and coffee, coupled with new session ideas from you. So get thinking.</p>

<p>Weâ€™ll be releasing more information about SRCCON over the next several weeks. Follow <a href="http://twitter.com/srccon">@SRCCON</a> to keep up on the latest, and  if you have any questions in the meantime, <a href="mailto:srccon@opennews.org">email us</a>.</p>

<p>SRCCON. Minneapolis. June 25+26. Hope to see you there.</p>
