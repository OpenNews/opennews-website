I"•<p>Earlier this year, we announced an opening for an assistant editor at Sourceâ€”and went on to receive an extraordinary set of applications from amazing candidates around the world. After an involved selection process, we are very happy to introduce <a href="http://lindsaymuscato.com">Lindsay Muscato</a>, Sourceâ€™s new assistant editor, who will be working with us on an upcoming site restructure and leading much of the day-to-day editorial work of keeping Source connected to the news code community.</p>

<p>Lindsay is a freelance journalist and editor working out of Chicago, and is currently completing a project with the <a href="http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/">Smart Chicago Collaborative</a> on a book about the <a href="http://www.chicagoschoolofdata.com/">Chicago School of Data</a>. Her web presence goes back to 1996, and her background includes filing stories from Phnom Penh, helping run <a href="http://www.writeclubnation.com/">WRITE CLUB</a>, and working with the amazing theater crew known as the <a href="http://neofuturists.org/">Neo-Futurists</a>.</p>

<p>Youâ€™ll be seeing Lindsayâ€™s byline on Source and, if you work on a newsroom tech or design team, youâ€™ll probably see her name pop up in your inbox or <a href="https://twitter.com/lmuscato">on Twitter</a> as she helps us expand our coverage of the news code community and the amazing things it makes.</p>

<p>Welcome, Lindsay!</p>
