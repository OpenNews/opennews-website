<h2>Gatherings</h2>
<p class="bodybig">We create spaces where the journalism-code community can gather and focus on the informal skillshares and insightful conversations that are the best parts of conferences.</p>

<p>We host events designed to provide space for those conversations and collaborations to bloom, surrounded by plentiful food, good coffee, and enthusiastic colleagues. We also host cohort-driven convenings to allow small groups of participants to really dig into questions and projects.&lt;/p&gt;</p>

<p><a href="srccon">SRCCON</a> is our largest event, a hands-on conference focused on the practical challenges news technology and data teams encounter every day. In August, we hosted our fourth SRCCON, and participants <a href="https://source.opennews.org/articles/tags/srccon-2017/">tackled everything from hiring technical staff to caregiving</a>. This year, weâ€™re hosting our first-ever SRCCON:WORK to explore how we as a community can help each other take on the hard work of journalism. <a href="srccon">Find out more</a>.</p>
