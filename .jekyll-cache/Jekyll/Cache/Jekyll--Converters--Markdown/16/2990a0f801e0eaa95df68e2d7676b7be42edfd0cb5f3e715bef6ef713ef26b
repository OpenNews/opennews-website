I"J<p><a href="http://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar2015/">NICAR</a> (officially the CAR Conference) is the annual gathering of data journalists and newsroom coders in the United States, from <a href="http://www.ire.org/">Investigative Reporters &amp; Editors (IRE)</a> and their <a href="http://www.ire.org/nicar/">National Institute of Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR)</a>. It’s where many in the field got their start, and where they return each year to refine their skills, reconnect with colleagues, and share their work and expertise.</p>

<p>We’ll be at NICAR in force this year, and we’re bringing <a href="http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/2015meet/">the entire 2015 cohort of Knight-Mozilla Fellows</a> to give them the opportunity to meet members of the community and dig into the technical and cultural details of the field as they get settled into their newsrooms.</p>
