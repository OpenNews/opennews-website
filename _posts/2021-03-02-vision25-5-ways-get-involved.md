The Online News Association, the Maynard Institute for Journalism Education and OpenNews are committed to dismantling systemic racism in the journalism industry and transforming news organizations into institutions of belonging. 

The past few months, we have worked behind the scenes scheming (the good kind) and strategizing new efforts through our [Vision25 collaboration](/blog/vision25-building-racial-equity-in-newsrooms). Weâ€™ve convened newsroom leaders, spoken to funders and even brought together many of the people who were newly minted in their news organizations to address diversity, equity and belonging. 

The conversations have been robust, revealing and troubling. In April, weâ€™ll share some of what weâ€™ve learned, including how the concept of belonging emerged as the aspiration we are pushing to see operationalized across the news industry.

Meanwhile, weâ€™d like to share with you five opportunities to participate in Vision25 this month, through an event, a fellowship, a coalition, and resources to ensure information equity. And there is more to come.

### OpenNews is launching the DEI Coalition For Anti-Racist, Equitable, And Just Newsrooms
Over the last several months, over 100 community volunteers have worked to create a digital community space dedicated to learning and taking concrete actions to create newsrooms and workplaces that are anti-racist, equitable and just. The space will serve as a place to work in solidarity across all levels of experience, on challenges members face in moving DEI forward in their newsrooms, and collectively creating strategies and resources to tackle those challenges. The development of this space has embodied the values of belonging that Vision25 is all about: OpenNews has intentionally designed the space with community leaders and members as a collaborative process. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeJncwQftMaZY_Z2-FKhmDg36K8CBPWcN00G3A0INSBwtePnQ/viewform">Sign up here</a> to be notified as soon as the community space, hosted on Slack, **opens later this March**.

### The Online News Associationâ€™s resource database for information access equity
The **#ONAinfoequity** database provides resources for journalists to engage communities that are historically under- or misrepresented in the media and ensure equitable access to information. Free Pressâ€™ Vanessa Maria Graber and ONA Board member Anita Li led over a dozen journalists to collaborate on this project through an ONA Community Circle. Itâ€™s a one-stop shop with guidance for identifying gaps in information access, making the case for community engagement to newsroom leadership and discovering ways to improve existing efforts.
