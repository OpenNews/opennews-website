2025 was a lot and 2026 is off to similar “lotness,” if I can use a nonsense word in serious moments. However, a bright point in 2025 was the engagement, support and persistence of OpenNews community members. If you missed [Jessica’s heartfelt end-of-year post celebrating this community](https://opennews.org/blog/opennews-to-build-a-butterfly/), please take a moment to reconnect (and boost up) now as we head deeper into 2026\.

Building on work started in 2025, today we are happy to announce a transition that usually happens behind the scenes: a move from an Advisory Board to an Advisory Council for OpenNews. Within this org-charty-sounding change there’s a good bit of detail and intention, so please continue reading our synopsis of what this change means.

## A bow of gratitude to our Advisory Board

First and foremost, we want to extend a deep and heartfelt thanks to the members of our Advisory Board. Through many changes, the Board has dedicated its time and expertise to guiding OpenNews directors and staff as they have jumped endless hurdles to keep the dream of OpenNews alive. The support of this Advisory group has played a foundational role in the success and stability of this community of optimistic doers.

Some Board members like me will be continuing their service (though the Council includes term limits). And some Board members who already volunteer in meaningful ways elsewhere in journalism will wrap up their time here and return to being supportive voices within OpenNews and beyond.

We’re grateful for the efforts of our Advisory Board, and we’re excited to introduce you to our Advisory Council later this month.

## Why this change now? Deeper engagement with your needs

Over the past fifteen(\!) years, the OpenNews community has proven its resilience amid many twists and turns in our personal and professional lives. And throughout, we have continued to build and hold an even more supportive and effective space for us all.

To ensure our directors have decisive, relevant and proactive advice for its *next* quindecennial, the Council structure will adopt greater responsibilities as our community and organizational needs change. The new Council has a charter that includes (in short):

* Increased roles, responsibilities and engagement  
* Rotation plans and fresh voices  
* Specialty sub-committees, when warranted  
* Ongoing and expanded support for OpenNews staff and events  
* And more\!

Moving to an Advisory Council is strategic, to ensure OpenNews remains a vibrant and responsive space for us all. By spring, the Council will be fully operational and focused on strategic support for our directors. This includes OpenNews’s consulting work, SRCCON, events, sustainability, community engagement, fundraising and more.

We are excited about this behind-the-scenes evolution and how you’ll see it in action this year. In the meantime, if you have feedback, we’re always happy to hear from you\! Give us a shout at <team@opennews.org>.
