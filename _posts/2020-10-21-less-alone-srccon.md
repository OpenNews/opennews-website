When we gathered for SRCCON 2020 in July, we really didn't know what to expect. Our community told us they still wanted to connect and [talk about everything from objectivity to data viz editing](https://2020.srccon.org/schedule/), but what would it _feel_ like online? Well, as one attendee put it: _"the event felt like a real SRCCON."_ As it well should. As we've all adapted to meeting from couches and kitchen tables instead of in front of whiteboards and coffee stations, we've found new ways to connect. And that ability to connect, share, dream, and grow is critical to not only getting through the challenges of this year, and beyond, but [repairing the harms](https://mediareparations.org/) that led us and our industry to this point.
 
_SRCCON “made me more confident about my media, my future, made me realize I was not alone in my view of journalism, it gave me hope for a journalism that truly represents me!”_ 
    
This year, sometimes that hope has been close at hand like when we met together in July, inspired and challenged by Black-led organizers in the streets and in our organizations. Other times, it couldn't have felt farther away. Together, we find chances to hold both of those realities and explore them together, as one SRCCON attendee put it: _“I feel like I can dream again.”_

While dreaming doesn't stick to any calendar, we are planning to gather as a community again for a [final SRCCON](https://srccon.org) in mid-December (with the emblematic tentative title SRCCON:???). We don't know right now what precise format or setting or theme may be most needed then, but from what our community shared at SRCCON 2020, we do know some things already:

* We will figure out what we need together, and then we'll make it happen
* We have one another to lean on in this work, and that support will create powerful coalitions
* We have the power to shape what comes next and we're going to use it

## We will figure this out together 
Changemaking is always a process of co-creation, and that collaborative, community-led approach has been at the core of SRCCON and everything we do at OpenNews. Through talks, sessions, and numerous Slack conversations, we saw SRCCON attendees planning and sharing and figuring out how to [reimagine and rebuild together](https://source.opennews.org/articles/srccon-2020-watch-parties-reaching-new-audiences/). A major theme at SRCCON 2020 was about how to approach this changemaking: burn it all down, go it alone, change from within? One attendee reflected: 
_"But I'm always reminded when I hear the term radical that radical means from the root. That's what the word means from the Latin. And you know, looking at that as an opportunity to do some gardening and weeding so that things can grow and flourish rather than looking to it as something that is going to smash down and destroy something you hold dear. Looking at it as a way of the rethinking things from the root."_

Conversations in July, and at [SRCCON:LEAD in 2019](/blog/srccon-lead-takeaways/) and other prior events engaged with all aspects of that necessary tending and the role each of us can play to make that change happen. As one attendee put it: _"SRCCON is just like a forum for real talk. ... when we come together in these sorts of communities, we can plan, we can start projects, we can start community funds for doing mutual aid. We can plan walkouts, we can unionize, we can do all of those things. ... we can come together, find each other, and begin."_

## We have one another to lean on
At SRCCON, we see again and again how many colleagues are also invested in taking on this work and in helping support each other through it. Sessions tackle technical challenges and managerial questions, but also sometimes literally gardening, tending tomato plants and pickling. Homeschooling and grieving. Music and gaming and walks along the Mississippi. 

When we get to know each other's interests and passions outside of work, we deepen our capacity to support one another in often difficult internal organizational work. It is through personal relationships that we learn how to trust, cultivate compassion, learn how to give each other what we need, and build the resilient networks required to organize coalitions and fight for lasting changes. Through these relationships, we see how:

**We are not alone** in staking out an [anti-racist vision for journalism](/blog/moving-far-beyond-diversity-how-vision25-came-together/).<br>
**We are not alone** in fighting isolation, confusion, and exhaustion [in covering COVID-19](https://source.opennews.org/articles/conversations-local-newsrooms-should-be-having-abo/).<br>
**We are not alone:** _"This conference is so good at welcoming people and not just making people feel welcome, but making people feel brave. And encouraging people that normally feel sheltered or oppressed in their newsrooms, like giving them a chance to speak up and speak their heart and mind."_

## We have the power to shape what comes next
When we turn to each other in times of joy and of uncertainty, we develop the strength for whatever comes next. Newsroom after newsroom continues a flood of unionizing, building collective power to not only have a seat at the table but use that power to determine what gets put on that table for discussion. This [community leads](/what/community/dei-coalition) unions and employee resource groups and diversity committees and community groups that offer support to each other and a bold vision for the future. 

Who has the power? We have the power. Together, we already know what we need, who we can trust, and what must be done: _"But I think really what SRCCON has done is bring the other people who are the true leaders, leading from where they are. People who have a stake in the game, you know, putting things on the line."_

At SRCCON, we get to see all of these dynamics in action: dreaming, plotting, leading, powerfully shifting news organizations and how they serve our communities. In addition, the SRCCON community blew us away with its support of OpenNews, with over 50 people [signing up as organizational sustainers during the conference](/donate). Sustaining each other and our work takes so many forms, from money to resume reviews and encouraging text messages¸each of the pieces of relationship and word building that willl enable us to create a new future together. 

We're always here for each other online and in those Slacks, and we'll meetup as a group again in mid-December. We know that now, and [we'll share more details](http://eepurl.com/czSVTL) about what to expect in mid-November. As always, our own experiences and relationships will tell us what we need to meet this moment, and how we can and must wield our relationships and collective power to transform our institutions: _"I feel less alone in this industry. It's nice to have a space filled with other journalists who care about and are engaged with the same issues I spend most of my time thinking about. It made me more optimistic about our collective futures, even if that future is still on shaky ground."_
