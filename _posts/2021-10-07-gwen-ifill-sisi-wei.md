We are thrilled to share that OpenNews co-executive director Sisi Wei [has been named](https://www.iwmf.org/2021/10/iwmf-names-sisi-wei-recipient-of-2021-gwen-ifill-award/) the recipient of the 2021 [Gwen Ifill award](https://www.iwmf.org/awards/gwen-ifill-award/), by the International Women’s Media Foundation.

The award honors Ifill’s legacy as an incredible journalist and advocate for journalists of color. Sisi’s work embodies that legacy, both before coming to OpenNews and in developing programs like the DEI Coalition here. As [Sisi put it](https://www.iwmf.org/2021/10/iwmf-names-sisi-wei-recipient-of-2021-gwen-ifill-award/) “There aren’t many awards in this industry that recognize people for helping others,_”_ and that recognition of the importance of [individual efforts in pursuit of collective goals](https://opennews.org/blog/to-be-in-community/) is fundamental to the [DEI Coalition](https://opennews.org/what/community/dei-coalition) and all of our work at OpenNews.

Regardless of job title or experience level, we know that people all across the journalism industry are pushing to make it a better place to work and to be an industry that works first in service of its communities, not just shareholders. To us, this award recognizes so many principles that we find critically important at OpenNews — learning from one another, designing spaces to help people connect, and being generous about sharing knowledge and expertise. These are all principles we see as essential to building a future where journalism values everyone, and all journalists enjoy the same levels of respect, support, and opportunity.

**We see each other as peers to learn from, and put aside titles and hierarchies.** We believe that when people are able to genuinely connect with each other as individuals, those relationships become the foundation for building trust and space for vulnerability. Only then can we create wider networks of action and support. 

**We design to include, not exclude.** We know that everyone has something to contribute and that we need the perspectives of everyone in journalism (and beyond) in order to solve this industry’s most difficult problems. Ensuring that everyone is able to contribute though, does not happen by accident and takes intentional design. For the DEI Coalition, this was a [collaborative process](https://source.opennews.org/guides/dei-coalition/) with more than 100 volunteers, facilitated by Sisi and [four committee leads](https://opennews.org/what/community/dei-coalition/).

**We share. A lot.** We share not only [ideas, processes, and techniques](http://source.opennews.org/), but also [money](https://microloansforjournalists.org/), [resources](https://2021.srccon.org/scholarships/), and [power](https://opennews.org/blog/announcing-co-executive-directors-and-director-of-network-development/). Only through sharing from a place of abundance, empathy, and mutual respect, can we create cultures of belonging, and build the skills we need to ensure that is the reality for the entire industry.

These principles animate everything we do at OpenNews, and we take so much inspiration from Gwen Ifill and the team at IWMF who understand the importance of this work and honoring its leaders. As [Ella Baker said](https://awpc.cattcenter.iastate.edu/2019/12/19/address-at-sncc-conference-dec-1963/), “... there's a lot of difference between the development of single individuals as leaders and the development of leadership, with leadership concepts, leadership goals, leadership methods that people can follow after we have moved on, and we must all move on from one point to the other." Baker, and her teachings on [leader-full movements](https://www.colorlines.com/articles/ella-taught-me-shattering-myth-leaderless-movement), is a core part of how OpenNews thinks about movements and changemaking, and we are so grateful to be in this work together with hundreds of other journalism leaders.

We receive so much inspiration and knowledge from the leaders who have come before us, especially Black women, and we could not be more honored that Sisi will be the fifth Gwen Ifill award recipient since it was founded in 2017, and joining the ranks of [four Black women](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ncwaHu9gZWk) who have broken barriers in the journalism industry.
