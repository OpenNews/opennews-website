This week is the [2018 National Institute for Computer Assisted Reporting](https://ire.org/conferences/nicar18/) conference, and the whole OpenNews team will be in Chicago for great sessions and conversation. We're looking forward to spending the week with hundreds of other journalilsts, tech folks, data lovers, and computer-assisted reporters to learn and share together. 

We're helping out with a few events where we'd love to see you:

* **Thursday, March 8 at 6pm** City Bureau's Public Newsroom this week will host a chat about the Chicago Civic Data Collaborative, and we're happy to sponsor the coffee. [Join us to learn more about the journalism and data communities in the city hosting us this week](https://www.facebook.com/events/945664222264702/).
* **Friday, March 9 at 8am** Meet up with Erin Kissane and Lindsay Muscato from our site Source to join in nerd conversation. We're gathering in the Knight Foundation space at the conferenceâ€”Armitage/Belmont, 4th floor.
* **Friday, March 9 at 7:30pm** Community member Rachel Shorey organized this news nerd night at the Chicago Design Museum and we're so psyched to sponsor it. [Please RSVP for a free spot at the museum, plus, snacks!](https://www.eventbrite.com/e/nicar-at-the-design-museum-tickets-43551891881)

In addition to these events, we're excited to help 19 community members get to NICAR as part of our [Ticket + Travel scholarship program](/what/community/scholarships). NICAR is always an exceptionally busy time and we can't wait for all the hallway conversations, sitting-room-only workshops, and more. During NICAR, we're going to be doing some needsfinding and planning related to our [News Integrity Intiative grant](https://www.journalism.cuny.edu/2017/10/news-integrity-initiative-awards-1-8-million-build-support-quality-journalism/) as well as supporting small events for journalists of color and lonely coders.

With so much going on, please reach out to us if you want to be sure we connect. You can reach all of us at [info@opennews.org](mailto:info@opennews.org) or contact us individually: [Dan](mailto:dan@opennews.org), [Erika](mailto:erika@opennews.org), [Ryan](ryan@opennews.org), [Erin](erin@opennews.org), or [Lindsay](lindsay@opennews.org) or wave us down and say hi.
