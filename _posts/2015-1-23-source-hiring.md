OpenNews is hiring a part-time assistant editor on a contract basis for [Source, our journalism-code community website](http://source.opennews.org). The assistant editor will work with our editor to handle daily shepherding of articles in process; will edit and produce two or three articles weekly in our CMS, and copyedit one or two more; will participate in biweekly OpenNews community calls and write short weekly round-up posts partly keyed from the community calls; and will work with the OpenNews team to make Source as responsive and useful as possible to the newsroom code community. The position will require 15-20 hours per week, on average. 

Our ideal candidate will be psyched about open source and open process in journalism, and will have experience writing and editing for publication, broadly speaking. Familiarity with relevant tech vocabulary is important—you don't have to code, but you'll need to be comfortable writing HTML, and to be able to follow descriptions of technical processes and choices. (You'll have backup on the team for this.) Most importantly, our assistant editor will feel comfortable checking in with our writers and developing friendly, supportive relationships with developers, designers, and data journalists around the world.

Greater involvement in the wider OpenNews world is optional—if you’re available for the occasional conference coverage assignment, great, and if you want to be involved in our events and other programs, we welcome it, but none of those things is required. All candidates must be able to work legally in the US, but your actual geographic location is irrelevant.

Women, people of color, and members of communities underrepresented in technology and journalism are especially encouraged to apply.

### About Source	
Source is a community hub for coders, data journalists, and interactive designers in and around newsrooms. We publish 10-15 articles most months, and will be targeting 15-20/month in 2015—but the articles vary widely in form, length, and level of effort. Our team works remotely via Slack, phone, and GIF.

### How to Apply
Please [send us a short email/cover letter](mailto:info@opennews.org) and include links to a resume or portfolio—or paste a plain text resume into the email, or whatever else makes sense, as long as it's not an attachment. Put "Assistant Editor" somewhere in the subject line. That's it. Wooo!
