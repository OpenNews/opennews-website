The fourth [SRCCON](https://www.srccon.org) brings us back to Minneapolis Minnesota on August 3-4. We will return to the McNamara Alumni Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota on the east bank of the University of Minnesota, where we held SRCCON in 2015. Get ready for two days of hands-on sessions building better newsroom code, culture, and processâ€”together.

Over the three SRCCONs we've [hosted](https://2014.srccon.org/) [so](https://2015.srccon.org/) [far](https://2016.srccon.org/), we saw how valuable it was as a space to connect. Participants frequently commented on having the chance both to catch up with old friends and to make connections with folks they had never met before. Friends new and old were able to dig into the types of discussions that can be challenging to find space for in the regular work day and at other events. We will continue to fold feedback from participants--in person and remote alike--into our planning for SRCCON, as well as all OpenNews programs. You can see themes from SRCCON represented on [Source](https://source.opennews.org) (which has a shiny redesign today), in our [community call](/what/community/calls) (also tune in today for further updates), in our expanded [convenings program](/what/conferences/convenings/), and our slate of [community offerings](/what/community/).

If your curious what that's all about, but you haven't attended SRCCON before, you can get a taste of what to expect from this video about last year's SRCCON:

For those of you that have attended SRCCON, we heard your feedback: you want more. SRCCON itself will remain two days and intentionally small (about 300 participants), but to better meet the demand for SRCCON, we're going to host a second, topical SRCCON this year. Near the end of the year, we'll host a topical SRCCON focused on a theme of interest to the journalism-code community. We'll announce more details about that during SRCCON this summer.

We'll have a lot more details to share about SRCCON soon. During [NICAR](https://ire.org/conferences/nicar2017/) at the beginning of March, we'll share the dates that tickets will go on sale and for the call for session proposals. If you're already eager to get connected, be sure to sign up for our email list and the [@SRCCON Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/srccon) for updates. And of your employer might be in a position to help make SRCCON happen, we are [looking for sponsors](https://www.srccon.org/sponsors).

The generosity and openness of this community is what makes SRCCON possible. We're excited to be able to create space for connection and community building at [SRCCON--back in Minneapolis this August](https://www.srccon.org).
