[SRCCON is back in 2015](http://srccon.org) for another two days of building better newsroom code, culture, and process, this time in beautiful Minneapolis. The conference will take place June 25 and 26, and tickets go on sale April 29.

Most importantly, [we are accepting session proposals through April 10](http://srccon.org/sessions/). Whether you attended last year's SRCCON or not, this is the perfect chance to get involved and bring conversations on topics you care about into the heart of this year's event. Session faciliators don't bring slides and aren't expected to deliver prepared talks—instead, we're looking for sessions designed around small-group conversation, hands-on skillshares, collaborative designing and building, or other formats that get attendees thinking, talking, and making together. 

### Exemplary Sessions

We've posted links to [a few excellent sessions from last year](http://srccon.org/sessions/#examples)—though there were far more than we could fit into a short list, so you can also check out the whole 2014 program. Right now, this year's proposals are rolling in and we're starting to [post them on the SRCCON website](http://srccon.org/sessions/proposals/). 

### SRCCON Session Q&A and Office Hours

Our [April 1 community call](http://opennews.org/what/community/calls/) will include a SRCCON session Q&A, and we'll be holding virtual office hours on April 1 and 7 to help with proposals, answer questions, and provide general encouragement to everyone interested in proposing a session. Follow [@SRCCON](https://twitter.com/srccon) or [@OpenNews](https://twitter.com/opennews) on Twitter to get notifications of these and other SRCCON-related events.
