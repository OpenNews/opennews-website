Six years ago I stood with Erin Kissane in front of a large whiteboard placing post-its outlining ideas for a publication that would feature the work of journalism technologists. In helping with this project, Erin was the first person I'd hired to work on what was still a few months away from being rechristened OpenNews.

That meeting in January 2012 lead to the launch of [Source](https://source.opennews.org/) in October of that year. Source [celebrated five years](https://source.opennews.org/articles/five-years-what-surprise/) this past October and has, over those years, inspired everything from our [biweekly community calls](https://opennews.org/what/community/calls/) to the [SRCCON line of conferences](https://opennews.org/what/conferences/srccon/). Erin has played a role in all of it, every step of the way.

Which is why it's hard to say goodbye to her today, her last day with OpenNews. Erin is leaving to spend more time with her daughter in the forest they've recently moved to, a worthy pursuit if ever there was one, but she will be missed deeply by all of us here at OpenNews.

Erin has been an amazing colleague to all of us here, offering insights and advice in everything we do. She's played a similar role in the larger journalism communities we work with and her absence will be felt there as well.

Erin's influence went far beyond the publications and projects she worked on over six years at OpenNews. The [code of conduct she drafted](http://incisive.nu/2014/codes-of-conduct/) for the first SRCCON, for instance, has been forked and modified by dozens of conferences since, many far outside journalism. The humane approach she took to everything she worked on lead the industry by example.

We are very lucky that Erin's role at Source will be filled by Lindsay Muscato who has been working with Erin at Source for almost three years. She'll be picking up where Erin left off with the publication and we're excited to see where she takes it.

Erin's accomplishments are many and her influence is vast, but mostly she's just great people and we are so thankful to have spent the years we have had with her.

-- everyone at OpenNews
