We just wrapped up two days at SRCCON:LEAD, talking about how [leadership in journalism can and must be different](https://source.opennews.org/articles/how-would-you-leadership-journalism-be-different/). One of the threads, explored in [talks and sessions](https://lead.srccon.org/transcription), was about the power and necessity of collective action: what becomes possible when we band together? As OpenNews has grown as an organization and network, we have repeatedly heard from people saying please, give us more ways to connect and help!

Today we're launching a new pathway to support this network and OpenNews: We're launching [a founding sustainer program](/donate) for ongoing financial contributions. I'm excited to be able to share this as a meaningful, concrete way to support the work that OpenNews does and the community we serve. 

## Why a sustainer program?

This community already supports each other in so many ways, from advice to job leads to code reviews. OpenNews has long played a role in helping knit together those connections. We're also developing new ways to strengthen that network, through programs like our [peer data review pilot](/what/community/datareview/). At this busy time of evolution, we're excited to share this sustainer program as a way to be able to:

* take collective action together in a new way! Alongside all of our other programs, this is another strategy for banding together and supporting the people and the work we care about.
* show it is possible to work with an ethic of abundance, not austerity. Collectively, we _do_ have the resources we need and we can pool them together, share them with one another. Give what you can, when you can, and know that a community has your back if and when you need it.
* fortify the long-term sustainability of OpenNews. Years of feedback and experience has shown us how important it is to provide spaces for connection and to invest in developing the capacity of individuals in this community. This program will ensure we can continue growing this network and its impact on the industry.

## More pathways for connection

Our intention with the launch of this founding sustainer program is to provide a space to deepen your relationship with OpenNews and this network. To create an additional way to contribute to something you may find meaningful. We're rolling out this program slowly, and as you would expect from OpenNews, we will be iterating on it over time.

Over the next few months, we'll have more to share. But if you've appreciated this network that OpenNews helps foster, [consider joining as a founding sustainer](/donate).
