OpenNews is hiring a full-time Director of Programs to help shape the future of our work.

OpenNews supports journalists pushing for technical and cultural change in newsrooms. Our purpose is to provide spaces where journalists can join a community, learn from each other, and take lessons back to their news organizations.

Our Director of Programs will help shape the vision, process, and programs for how OpenNews will continue to serve this community for many years to come.

## About You
We're at an inflection point for OpenNews and the journalists, technologists and civic-minded people that we serve. Our community — reporters, developers, designers, data analysts, and editors — is poised to move into leadership roles and push news organizations to function in a more inclusive and interdependent way.

You might be a part of this community, or you may bring a perspective from a totally different field. You may be a strong candidate to be our Director of Programs if you have a deep interest in how networks, communities, and systems work. OpenNews continues to evolve in response to our community and facilitates making that community's work easier: more efficient, more community-focused, and more collaborative. At the heart of our work is the belief that working together as peers we have the wisdom and experience we need to remake our organizations so that they work for, and serve, everyone. You may thrive in this setting if you are adaptive, enjoy exploring ideas, and have a knack for knowing when to bring brainstorming down to earth and make an awesome timeline and plan.

## About The Team
We are an all-remote team and greatly value interpersonal communication skills. The day to day work will be guided by the OpenNews team and our community as we plan for the future. This work will likely include:

* community capacity building and support programs, in particular for journalists of color and journalists at local/regional outlets
* event and conference planning (for 10 to 300 people)
* writing, speaking, and research about the field
* organizational development, fundraising, and strategic planning
* travel a few times a year for major events and team meetings

You may not have experience in all of those areas, but we would like you to have demonstrated experience in one or two of them. In addition, a capacity to learn or delegate to others is essential. OpenNews is an efficient team and we'll work together to figure out the complement of skills and roles within current staff.

OpenNews benefits:

* All-remote team
* Salary will reflect that this is a director-level position, and be compensated as such
* Fully paid health care insurance premium for employee and family
* Dental and vision
* Life insurance
* A health and wellness fund
* Health and child care savings accounts
* Employer retirement contribution after two years of service
* Flexible work hours and team-wide support for work-life balance
