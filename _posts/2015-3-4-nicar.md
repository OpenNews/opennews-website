[NICAR](http://www.ire.org/conferences/nicar2015/) (officially the CAR Conference) is the annual gathering of data journalists and newsroom coders in the United States, from [Investigative Reporters & Editors (IRE)](http://www.ire.org/) and their [National Institute of Computer-Assisted Reporting (NICAR)](http://www.ire.org/nicar/). It's where many in the field got their start, and where they return each year to refine their skills, reconnect with colleagues, and share their work and expertise.

We'll be at NICAR in force this year, and we're bringing [the entire 2015 cohort of Knight-Mozilla Fellows](http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/2015meet/) to give them the opportunity to meet members of the community and dig into the technical and cultural details of the field as they get settled into their newsrooms.

### Coming to NICAR? Let's Talk

While you're at NICAR, **Dan Sinker** wants to talk to you about [becoming a news partner](http://opennews.org/getinvolved/newspartners/), [the Coral Project](http://coralproject.net/), and about anything else OpenNews. **Erika Owens** is taking point on the [Knight-Mozilla Fellowships](http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/) and [OpenNews-sponsored hack days and other events](http://opennews.org/what/community/eventsupport/), and **Erin Kissane** will be lurking in sessions and hallways to chat about [Source articles](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/), [SRCCON pitches](http://srccon.org/), and [OpenNews community calls](http://opennews.org/what/community/calls/).

And here's where you can find us:

Simple. Flexible. Modular. Open source.

We're looking for a lead developer to help us craft it, and we also want to hear from *you* about what we should do and how we should do it.

Check out the [lead developer](http://careers.mozilla.org/en-US/position/oe590fwc) listing and please do stop by to chat about the project and how we can make it work for news organizations large and small. **Greg Barber** will be on the scene, and waiting to hear from you—[hit Greg up on email if you want to set up a one-on-one](mailto:greg.barber@washpost.com).

#### 1pm: OpenNews Lonely Coders Lunch
