Today we kick off our _fifth_ search for Knight-Mozilla Fellows. It's been a remarkably fast five years filled with some of the most remarkable, talented, and inspiring people we've had the pleasure of getting to know. And now you (yes you!) can join them by [applying to become a 2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellow today](/what/fellowships/apply).

Knight-Mozilla Fellows spend ten months building, experimenting, and collaborating at the  intersection of journalism and the open web. Our fellows have worked on projects that [liberate data from inside PDFs](http://tabula.technology/), [stitch together satellite imagery](http://projects.propublica.org/louisiana/) to demonstrate the erosion of coastline in Louisiana, help [journalists understand the security implications of their work](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kVhmxHmoXlk), [improve our understanding of site metrics](https://source.opennews.org/en-US/articles/promotion-pageviews/), and much much more.

We want our fellows to spend time tackling real-world problems, and so for the last five years we have embedded our fellows in some of the best newsrooms in the world. For 2016 we have an amazing lineup of fellowship hosts once again: the [Los Angeles Times Data Desk](http://www.latimes.com/), [NPR](http://www.npr.org/), [Vox Media](http://www.voxmedia.com/), [Frontline](http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/), [Correct!v](https://correctiv.org/en/), and [The Coral Project](http://coralproject.net/) (a collaboration between the New York Times, the Washington Post, and Mozilla).

Our fellows are given the freedom to try new things, follow their passions, and write open-source code that helps to drive journalism (and the web) forward. Over the course of the next two and a half months you'll be hearing a lot more from us about the many exciting opportunities a Knight-Mozilla Fellowship brings, the impact journalism code has had on the web, and why you (yes you!) should apply to become a 2016 Knight-Mozilla Fellow. Or, [you can just apply now](/what/fellowships/apply).
