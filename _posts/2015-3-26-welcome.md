Earlier this year, we announced an opening for an assistant editor at Sourceâ€”and went on to receive an extraordinary set of applications from amazing candidates around the world. After an involved selection process, we are very happy to introduce [Lindsay Muscato](http://lindsaymuscato.com), Source's new assistant editor, who will be working with us on an upcoming site restructure and leading much of the day-to-day editorial work of keeping Source connected to the news code community.

Lindsay is a freelance journalist and editor working out of Chicago, and is currently completing a project with the [Smart Chicago Collaborative](http://www.smartchicagocollaborative.org/) on a book about the [Chicago School of Data](http://www.chicagoschoolofdata.com/). Her web presence goes back to 1996, and her background includes filing stories from Phnom Penh, helping run [WRITE CLUB](http://www.writeclubnation.com/), and working with the amazing theater crew known as the [Neo-Futurists](http://neofuturists.org/).

You'll be seeing Lindsay's byline on Source and, if you work on a newsroom tech or design team, you'll probably see her name pop up in your inbox or [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/lmuscato) as she helps us expand our coverage of the news code community and the amazing things it makes.

Welcome, Lindsay!
