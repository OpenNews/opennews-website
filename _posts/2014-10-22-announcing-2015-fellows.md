title: Announcing our 2015 Knight-Mozilla Fellows!

excerpt: Live from the 2014 Mozilla Festival in London, we're thrilled to introduce our 2015 Knight-Mozilla Fellows. The work that the Knight-Mozilla Fellows do during their fellowship year doesn't fit easily into a single sentence. Over the year a fellow will play the role of coder, teacher, mentor (and mentee), adventurer, colleague, and friend. They'll push themselves, and journalism, in new directions. They'll do work that has real impact--on themselves and on the web. It's a tall order, but a thrilling one, and the people we have lined up to do the work of a Knight-Mozilla Fellow in 2015 are among our very best yet. I can't wait for you to meet them.

We've been looking for Knight-Mozilla Fellows for four years now, and so you begin to notice patterns during the process. There's that moment when you worry that there won't be enough applicants, and then that other when you worry there will be too many. There's that melancholy time when you realize that you won't have a fellowship cohort quite like the current one and then the exhilaration when you realize <i>that's exactly right</i>.

But the most important moment is the one when all the pieces begin to come together and you begin to see not an <i>applicant</i> but instead a <i>fellow</i>. That moment is magic: the sheer volume of applications (417 this year--our largest pool ever) disappears and where there was once a mass of qualifications and ideas, you begin to see truly extraordinary <i>individuals</i>.

It's a great pleasure today to introduce those individuals--our 2015 Knight-Mozilla Fellows--to you. These folks will spend 10 months in 2015 experimenting in some of the best newsrooms in the world (they'll be joined by one more Fellow, at Vox Media, who will be announced later this year), on a mission to try new things, to document them in the open, and to connect with the broader community of people writing code in journalism.

The work that the Knight-Mozilla Fellows do during their fellowship year doesn't fit easily into a single sentence. Over the year a fellow will play the role of coder, teacher, mentor (and mentee), adventurer, colleague, and friend. They'll push themselves, and journalism, in new directions. They'll do work that has real impact--on themselves and on the web.

It's a tall order, but a thrilling one, and the people we have lined up to do the work of a Knight-Mozilla Fellow in 2015 are among our very best yet. I can't wait for you to meet them:
