JULY 16, 2025 – OpenNews, NC Local, and Newspack will create “Emergency Mode for News,” which equips local newsrooms with a plan and support to keep their communities informed when disasters happen, with funding from Press Forward, a national initiative to reimagine local news.

Local news organizations are critical lifelines during disasters. This project builds on lessons NC Local and others learned through reporting and collaboration during Hurricane Helene, incorporating those insights into a disaster reporting playbook. In addition, OpenNews will lead the development of a peer-learning program with a curriculum derived from the playbook and designed to promote relationship-building and mutual support before a newsroom goes into emergency mode. Newspack will advise on tools and techniques that newsrooms can adopt to respond to breaking news events and create open source software to help newsrooms publish breaking news and launch a fast-loading text-only site designed for areas without broadband access.

The funding is part of Press Forward’s Open Call on Infrastructure, which is providing $22.7 million to 22 projects that address the urgent challenges local newsrooms face today. The list of recipients is online at pressforward.news/infrastructure25.

OpenNews is a project of Community Partners, a 501(c)(3) that aims to create more equitable, just and vibrant communities. OpenNews supports journalists working at the intersection of journalism and technology, approaching their work with an ethos that emphasizes care for a community grappling with complex problems.
