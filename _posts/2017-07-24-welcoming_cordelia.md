As we enter the last few days before SRCCON, we're so excited to get some additional help: B Cordelia Yu has joined us as program and communications coordinator till the end of this year. We're grateful to everyone who applied [to help us out](blog/temp-position/) and bring skills to our team from within and beyond journalism tech. Cordelia comes to us with deep experience in content strategy, plus they know us well as a prior collaborator and event participant (PS they're [facilitating a session at SRCCON next week](http://schedule.srccon.org/#_session-change-our-minds)).

B Cordelia Yu is a content & editorial strategist and independent researcher at the intersection of social justice, civic tech, public policy, and digital design. They help organizations build inclusive editorial teams and products to foster democratic communities and expanding access to communities of knowledge. Their [research](http://tinyletter.com/thebestsophist) is in creating models for open governance and technology-mediated deliberative democratic practices.

Cordelia will help us with a lot of behind the scenes work, and you may start to see their name crop up in your inbox as well as they work on our outreach and communications. We're glad to be able to work with Cordelia, and to have support on the many emails, blog posts, and other updates we've got brewing for you.

Welcome, Cordelia!
