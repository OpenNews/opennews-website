Next year will be the fifth year of the Knight-Mozilla Fellowship program and we're looking for our next group of fellowship partners. If your news organization is interested in hosting a fellow next year, [fill out this form](/what/fellowships/partnerguidelines/#form) by April 24.

Over the last four years of the program, we've worked with news organizations on several continents, in multiple languages, and with various areas of editorial focus. We're grateful to the news organizations that have [hosted 26 fellows](http://opennews.org/what/fellowships/community/) and offered the space and support for fellows to spend 10 months exploring, collaborating, and sharing with colleagues throughout the newsroom and beyond.

Hosting a fellow is a chance to bring a new perspective to your newsroom. Fellows bring creativity and expertise on a range of technical topics to collaborate on those projects that you've always wanted to build, but have had trouble carving out time for between deadlines. News organizations who host fellows also join a small cohort--just like the fellows do--with the potential for collaboration and camaraderie between partners.

We've found that fellows really thrive at news organizations that have well-established tech teams where they can build strong peer relationships while also experimenting and collaborating with the broader journalism code community. The [application form](#form) we put together has some questions to help us get a better idea of your team and your vision for what a fellowship could look like.

The fellowship program is a great way for OpenNews to collaborate closely with a small number of news organizations. We're looking for five fellowship partners for 2016, but we also know there are a ton of other ways for us to collaborate with news organizations--from posting job listings on Source to sponsoring events to participating in code covenings. Through this process we have a chance to get to know more about your news organization and ways we can work together.

We'll be available over the next couple of weeks during office hours, at events, and [via email](mailto:info@opennews.org) if you have any questions or would like to talk a little more about the fellowship program. Once we receive applications, we'll review all of them and select a group to interview in May. We will announce the 2016 cohort of fellowship partners with the start of the fellowship search in early June. [Drop us a line](mailto:info@opennews.org) if you have any questions, and we look forward to learning more about your team.
